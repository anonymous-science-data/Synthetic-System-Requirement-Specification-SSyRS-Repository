Guest users receive generalized recommendations without authentication.
Sensitivity of Actions:

High Sensitivity: Viewing and modifying preference settings or browsing history.
Moderate Sensitivity: Interaction with recommended products.
Low Sensitivity: Viewing general trending or popular items.
3. Non-Functional Requirements
Performance:

Recommendations must load within 500 milliseconds to ensure a seamless user experience.
System should handle up to 50,000 recommendation requests per second during peak hours.
Scalability:

Capable of scaling horizontally to support traffic spikes during sales or festive seasons.
Reliability:

99.9% uptime with mechanisms to fall back to cached recommendations during failures.
Security:

Encrypt user data used for generating recommendations.
Implement strict access controls for viewing or altering recommendation algorithms.
Usability:
