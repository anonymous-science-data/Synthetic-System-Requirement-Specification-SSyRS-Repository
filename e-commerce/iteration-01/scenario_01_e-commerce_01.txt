E-Commerce Authentication System Scenario
1. System Overview
System Purpose:
The system is designed to provide secure, seamless, and efficient authentication for users interacting with an e-commerce platform. Its main objectives include ensuring data security, enabling user-friendly access, and supporting the diverse authentication needs of customers, vendors, and administrators.

Domain/Context:
The system operates in the e-commerce sector, focusing on online retail and marketplace platforms that serve both business-to-consumer (B2C) and business-to-business (B2B) models.

Stakeholders:

Customers: End-users purchasing products or services.
Vendors: Sellers managing product listings, inventory, and sales.
Platform Administrators: Oversee platform operations and ensure compliance.
Third-Party Payment Providers: Ensure secure and verified payment processes.
Regulatory Authorities: Monitor compliance with data protection and e-commerce regulations.
User Base Characteristics:

Size: Millions of users globally.
Diversity: Includes individuals of varying technical proficiency, language, and accessibility needs.
Geographic Distribution: Spans multiple countries, requiring multi-language support and region-specific compliance.
Roles: Customers, vendors, administrators, and support staff.
2. Functional Requirements
Core Features:

User registration and secure login.
Two-factor authentication (2FA) for sensitive actions like payment processing.
Password recovery and management.
Single sign-on (SSO) for integrated services such as loyalty programs or third-party platforms.
Role-based access control for different user groups (e.g., customers, vendors, admins).
Frequency of Authentication:

Initial login at session start.
Re-authentication required for high-sensitivity actions like updating payment methods or changing personal information.
Sensitivity of Actions:

High Sensitivity: Payment transactions, personal data updates, vendor payouts.
Moderate Sensitivity: Product reviews, adding items to the cart.
Low Sensitivity: Browsing and searching products.
3. Non-Functional Requirements
Performance:

Login response time of less than 2 seconds.
Capacity to handle 10,000 simultaneous authentication requests.
Scalability:

Must support a 50% increase in traffic during peak shopping periods without performance degradation.
Reliability:

99.99% uptime with automatic failover and redundancy mechanisms.
Recovery from failures within 5 minutes.
Security:

End-to-end encryption for all authentication data.
Regular vulnerability assessments and penetration testing.
Compliance with industry standards like PCI DSS and GDPR.
Usability:

Intuitive user interface for authentication processes.
Accessibility support for visually impaired users (e.g., screen reader compatibility).
Multi-language support for global reach.
4. Constraints
Technical Constraints:

Must integrate with existing platform architecture built on a microservices framework.
Authentication system must be compatible with mobile and desktop devices.
Compliance Requirements:

Adherence to GDPR for data protection in the EU.
PCI DSS compliance for secure payment processing.
Local data residency requirements for specific regions.
Resource Constraints:

Limited budget for the initial implementation phase.
Development team capacity restricted to 10 engineers.
Integration Needs:

Seamless integration with third-party identity providers (e.g., Google, Apple, Facebook).
API compatibility with external analytics tools for tracking authentication success rates.
This scenario outlines a comprehensive framework for designing an authentication system tailored to the needs of an e-commerce platform, balancing functionality, security, and user experience.
