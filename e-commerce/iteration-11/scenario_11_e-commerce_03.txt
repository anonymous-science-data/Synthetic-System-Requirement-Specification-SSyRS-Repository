Synthetic System Requirements Specification (SSRS)
System Name: AgroMart - Digital Wholesale Marketplace for Regional Agricultural Produce

1. System Overview
System Purpose:
AgroMart is a regionalized E-Commerce platform enabling digital wholesale trade of agricultural goods between farmers' cooperatives, food processors, and retailers. It is designed to streamline supply chains, reduce wastage, and improve transparency and pricing for producers and buyers in rural and semi-urban economies.

Domain/Context:
Agri-tech and E-Commerce, with a focus on regional agricultural trade networks. The system empowers local producers and buyers by digitizing bulk produce transactions and connecting them through a logistics-enabled online marketplace.

Stakeholders:

Agricultural Cooperatives and Smallholder Farmers

Food Processors and Distributors

Local Retail Chains and Restaurants

Regional Trade Authorities and Agricultural Boards

Platform Administrators and Logistics Partners

Agricultural Finance and Insurance Providers

User Base Characteristics:

Size: Projected 60,000 users within the first 2 years

Diversity: Cooperatives, processors, logistics agents, regulators, and SMEs

Geographic Distribution: Rural and peri-urban areas across Eastern Europe and Central Asia

Roles: Sellers (farmers/cooperatives), Buyers (retailers, processors), Logistics Agents, Admins, Auditors

Operational Environment:

Hybrid architecture: centralized cloud backend with offline-capable mobile apps

Primary access via Android app optimized for low-connectivity environments

Web interface for processors, regulators, and admin users

Data hosted in regional cloud zones for compliance and latency optimization

Usage Scenarios:

A cooperative posts a weekly bulk lot of potatoes for sale, selecting verified buyers from a regional whitelist.

A retailer places a standing order for seasonal produce and tracks fulfillment via mobile.

A logistics partner receives a notification to pick up and deliver produce with real-time tracking.

A regional authority audits bulk order logs for subsidy eligibility verification.

A buyer disputes delivery weight, triggering a mediation workflow involving platform support.

2. Functional Requirements
Core Features:

Bulk lot creation with item-level grading and geo-tagging

Purchase order management with tiered volume pricing and delivery windows

Integration with weather forecasting APIs for harvest planning support

Mobile-based logistics coordination with vehicle and driver assignment

Inventory-based alert system for perishable goods nearing shelf-life

Buyer-seller messaging module with mediated dispute resolution

Localized tax and compliance documentation auto-generation

Analytics dashboard for cooperatives to monitor sales performance and pricing trends

Offline transaction queuing with auto-sync when connectivity is restored

Authentication Conditions & Frequency:

Authentication is required upon each session start

Re-authentication is triggered before initiating payment release, editing order details, or disputing delivery records

For offline users, cached sessions expire after 60 minutes of inactivity, and re-authentication is required upon reconnecting to the network

Sensitivity of Actions & Permission Levels:

High Sensitivity: Payment release, contract modification, compliance reporting - allowed only for authorized admins and financial agents

Medium Sensitivity: Editing orders, managing logistics assignments - restricted to verified users with transaction history

Low Sensitivity: Viewing available lots, browsing analytics dashboards - open to logged-in users based on role

3. Non-Functional Requirements
Performance:

Response time <= 2.5 seconds for all core transactions on 3G connections

Mobile app must process offline transactions and sync within 5 seconds of reconnect

Concurrent capacity of up to 2,000 simultaneous active users during harvest season peaks

Scalability:

Designed to support regional scaling to an additional 8 countries with minimal configuration

Backend supports modular market zones with configurable tax, currency, and language settings

Scalability target: 500,000 transactions/month by Year 3

Reliability:

System uptime of 99.8%

Offline transaction durability guaranteed for up to 72 hours without network access

Automated recovery of failed sync attempts and retry logic for critical workflows

Security:

Role-based access control with granular permissions

Sensitive data such as pricing agreements, payouts, and trade certificates encrypted at rest and in transit

Anomaly detection algorithms to flag suspicious bulk order patterns

Usability:

Local language support in Russian, Ukrainian, Uzbek, and Kazakh

Visual, icon-driven UI for low-literacy users

Voice note support in the messaging module for users unfamiliar with typing

Audit & Monitoring:

Timestamped logs of authentication events, order modifications, and delivery records

Audit dashboard for trade authorities to inspect transaction patterns and certifications

Daily reporting feeds available via secure FTP for regulatory bodies

4. Constraints
Technical Constraints:

All client-side modules must support Android 7.0+

Offline functionality must operate without dependency on third-party background services (e.g., Google Play Services)

No dependency on continuous mobile data; must operate under intermittent 2G/3G connectivity

Compliance Requirements:

Must comply with national agricultural subsidy documentation standards (per country)

GDPR compliance for EU-linked user and transaction data

Traceability standards for food safety and transport in accordance with UNECE FFV-25

Resource Constraints:

Budget: $3.8 million across 36 months (including localization, outreach, and infrastructure)

Timeline: 14-month MVP, 24-month functional expansion, 36-month cross-border roll-out

Team Size: 34 FTEs (10 backend engineers, 6 mobile devs, 3 QA, 5 domain analysts, 2 UI/UX, 4 DevOps, 4 support & outreach)

Integration Needs:

Integration with mobile money APIs (e.g., M-Pesa, Qiwi) for payment disbursement

Regional freight network APIs for assigning vehicle logistics

Data exchange with agricultural boards for crop certification validation
