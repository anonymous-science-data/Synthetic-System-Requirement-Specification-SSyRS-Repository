E-Commerce System Scenario: "LocalHarvest"
1. System Overview
System Purpose:
"LocalHarvest" is a niche e-commerce platform designed to connect local farmers and artisanal producers with urban consumers seeking fresh, organic, and sustainably sourced products. The system's primary objective is to provide an intuitive marketplace where farmers can list and sell their goods, while consumers can shop for fresh produce, schedule deliveries, and support local agriculture.

Domain/Context:
E-commerce, specifically in the local food and sustainable agriculture sector.

Stakeholders:

Farmers and Producers: Local growers, small-scale food artisans, and organic farms looking to expand their customer base.
Consumers: Urban households seeking fresh, local, and ethically sourced food.
Marketplace Operators: Internal team responsible for vetting vendors, managing logistics, and ensuring smooth operations.
Logistics Providers: Local delivery companies that transport goods from farms to customers.
User Base Characteristics:

Size: At launch, the platform is expected to support 500 farmers and 50,000 monthly active customers, scaling to 200,000 customers within two years.
Diversity: Farmers and artisans with varied product offerings; customers range from single professionals to families.
Geographic Distribution: Initial focus on metropolitan areas within a 200-mile radius of farm locations, expanding regionally over time.
Roles:
Farmers (product listers, order managers).
Consumers (shoppers, subscription managers).
Administrators (platform managers, vendor approvers).
Operational Environment:
LocalHarvest will be cloud-hosted, leveraging a geographically distributed infrastructure for performance and reliability. Customers and vendors access the system through a mobile-first web application, supported by native apps for iOS and Android.

Usage Scenarios:

A consumer searches for weekly grocery items, adds them to their cart, and schedules a delivery.
A farmer uploads a new product batch, adjusts inventory, and monitors orders.
An administrator reviews new vendor applications and resolves disputes between buyers and sellers.
2. Functional Requirements
Core Features:

Vendor Management: Farmer registration, product uploads, and inventory tracking.
Product Catalog: Category-based browsing, advanced filtering, and personalized recommendations.
Shopping Cart & Checkout: Support for individual purchases and subscription models (e.g., weekly produce boxes).
Delivery Scheduling: Integrated scheduling tools for consumers, allowing flexibility in delivery slots.
Consumer Support: Chat-based helpdesk and FAQs for troubleshooting.
Admin Tools: Vendor approval workflows, dispute resolution management, and system monitoring.
Authentication Conditions & Frequency:

Consumers authenticate once per session, with re-authentication required after 60 minutes of inactivity or when updating sensitive account details (e.g., delivery address, payment information).
Farmers authenticate at the start of each session, with additional authentication required for high-sensitivity actions like bank detail updates or bulk inventory changes.
Administrators re-authenticate every 90 minutes or when accessing sensitive data, such as vendor financial records.
Sensitivity of Actions & Permission Levels:

High Sensitivity: Modifying payment details (farmers, customers), viewing financial summaries (administrators).
Medium Sensitivity: Managing delivery schedules (customers), updating inventory levels (farmers).
Low Sensitivity: Browsing the product catalog or checking delivery status (customers).
3. Non-Functional Requirements
Performance:

The system must respond within 1.5 seconds for 95% of all user actions.
Must handle up to 10,000 concurrent users during peak ordering periods (e.g., weekends).
Scalability:

Support up to 500,000 product listings and double the initial user base within three years.
Auto-scale to manage seasonal spikes in demand, particularly during harvest seasons.
Reliability:

99.95% uptime SLA.
Failover support to ensure uninterrupted service during server outages.
Security:

All transactions and data transmissions must be encrypted.
Fine-grained access control for different user roles.
Usability:

Simple, mobile-optimized interfaces for consumers and farmers, with tutorial pop-ups for first-time users.
Compliance with accessibility standards (e.g., WCAG 2.1).
Audit & Monitoring:

Comprehensive logging of vendor activities (e.g., product updates, inventory changes).
Daily reports on authentication events, financial transactions, and system errors.
4. Constraints
Technical Constraints:

Dependence on third-party APIs for logistics and payment processing.
Cloud hosting provider limitations on storage and compute resources for rapid scaling.
Compliance Requirements:

GDPR compliance for handling consumer data in Europe.
Adherence to local food safety regulations for vendor eligibility.
Resource Constraints:

Development budget of $1.5 million with an annual maintenance budget of $400,000.
A team of 15 developers, 5 designers, and 8 quality assurance specialists for an 18-month development timeline.
Integration Needs:

APIs for logistics providers to manage delivery schedules dynamically.
Compatibility with accounting platforms like QuickBooks for farmer bookkeeping.
This scenario outlines a realistic implementation of an e-commerce platform focused on local food systems, reflecting the unique challenges and opportunities in this niche domain.
