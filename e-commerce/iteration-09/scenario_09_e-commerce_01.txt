E-Commerce System Scenario
1. System Overview
System Purpose:
The system, "ShopConnect Marketplace," is designed to serve as an advanced multi-vendor e-commerce platform that facilitates seamless online retailing for small to medium-sized businesses (SMBs). Its primary objectives include empowering vendors to showcase their products, providing customers with a personalized shopping experience, and optimizing order fulfillment with integrated logistics solutions.

Domain/Context:
E-commerce, specifically multi-vendor marketplaces catering to diverse product categories such as fashion, electronics, home goods, and artisanal products.

Stakeholders:

Vendors: Small and medium-sized businesses looking to sell their products.
Customers: Retail consumers searching for an online shopping platform with varied product offerings.
Marketplace Administrators: Internal team responsible for monitoring platform operations and resolving disputes.
Logistics Providers: Third-party services integrated to handle order delivery and inventory management.
User Base Characteristics:

Size: Approximately 5,000 active vendors and 500,000 monthly active customers at launch, expected to scale to 1 million active customers within two years.
Diversity: Vendors operate across various industries, while customers represent a broad demographic with diverse shopping preferences.
Geographic Distribution: Initially focusing on North America, with plans for phased expansion to Europe and Asia.
Roles:
Customers (browsers, purchasers).
Vendors (store owners, product managers).
Administrators (platform managers, dispute resolution specialists).
Operational Environment:
The system will be hosted on a cloud-based infrastructure using a multi-region architecture to ensure global availability and performance. It will be accessible via a web portal and mobile applications (iOS and Android).

Usage Scenarios:

A customer searches for a product, adds it to their cart, and completes checkout with integrated payment options.
A vendor uploads product details, sets pricing, and tracks sales performance through dashboards.
An administrator reviews flagged transactions for potential disputes or fraud.
2. Functional Requirements
Core Features:

Vendor Management: Vendor registration, product uploads, pricing, inventory management.
Product Catalog: Advanced search, filtering, and personalized recommendations.
Shopping Cart & Checkout: Multi-item support, discount application, and seamless payment gateway integration.
Order Fulfillment: Order tracking, delivery scheduling, and integration with third-party logistics providers.
Customer Support: Chatbots, ticketing system, and vendor-customer messaging.
Dispute Resolution: Tools for administrators to handle conflicts between vendors and customers.
Authentication Conditions & Frequency:

Customers authenticate once per session, with re-authentication required after 30 minutes of inactivity or when performing sensitive actions (e.g., updating payment details or viewing order history).
Vendors authenticate at the beginning of each session, with additional re-authentication required for sensitive actions like altering banking details or making bulk product changes.
Administrators must re-authenticate every 60 minutes or before accessing system-level logs or user account data.
Sensitivity of Actions & Permission Levels:

High Sensitivity: Modifying payment details (customers), editing bank accounts (vendors), or accessing sensitive customer/vendor information (administrators).
Medium Sensitivity: Viewing sales analytics (vendors) or order histories (customers).
Low Sensitivity: Browsing products or checking delivery statuses (customers).
3. Non-Functional Requirements
Performance:

Response time must be under 2 seconds for 95% of customer interactions.
The system must handle up to 20,000 concurrent users during peak sales events.
Scalability:

Support seamless addition of new vendors and up to 10 million product listings within the first three years.
Auto-scaling to accommodate promotional events (e.g., Black Friday sales).
Reliability:

99.9% uptime SLA.
Automated failover mechanisms for critical services.
Security:

End-to-end encryption for all transactions.
Role-based access control to restrict unauthorized data access.
Usability:

Intuitive user interfaces tailored for each user role (customers, vendors, administrators).
Compliance with accessibility standards (e.g., WCAG 2.1).
Audit & Monitoring:

Detailed logging of all user actions, including product updates, purchases, and sensitive actions.
Regular audit trails for financial transactions and access to sensitive data.
4. Constraints
Technical Constraints:

Integration with specific logistics providers' APIs for real-time order tracking.
Dependency on third-party payment gateways with predefined processing limits.
Compliance Requirements:

Adherence to GDPR for European customers.
PCI-DSS compliance for payment processing security.
Resource Constraints:

Initial development budget of $2 million, with an annual maintenance budget of $500,000.
A team of 20 developers, 5 designers, and 10 quality assurance specialists available during the initial 12-month development phase.
Integration Needs:

Compatibility with existing vendor accounting tools (e.g., QuickBooks, Xero).
APIs for third-party analytics and marketing platforms like Google Analytics and Facebook Ads Manager.
This scenario outlines the realistic development of a multi-vendor e-commerce system, incorporating industry-specific challenges and requirements.
