E-Commerce Scenario: AI-Driven Virtual Fitting Room for Fashion Retail
1. System Overview
System Purpose:
The system aims to enhance the online shopping experience for fashion retail customers by providing an AI-driven virtual fitting room. This feature enables customers to visualize how clothing items would fit and look on them based on personalized measurements and body types.

Domain/Context:
The e-commerce fashion retail industry, focusing on reducing return rates and improving customer satisfaction for online clothing purchases.

Stakeholders:

Customers: Individuals shopping for apparel.
Retailers: Businesses hosting their products on the platform.
Product Designers: Teams responsible for ensuring accurate 3D models of garments.
Customer Support Teams: Handling inquiries related to sizing and order issues.
System Administrators: Overseeing platform functionality and security.
User Base Characteristics:

Size: Initially targeting 100,000 active users, scaling to 1 million within two years.
Diversity: Wide range of demographics, primarily focusing on urban and suburban regions with high fashion e-commerce activity.
Roles: Customers, fashion retailers, administrators, and support teams.
Operational Environment:
The system will operate as a cloud-hosted platform accessible via web browsers and mobile apps, supporting integration with major fashion e-commerce websites.

Usage Scenarios:

Customers: Upload body measurements or photos to create a virtual avatar, try on garments virtually, and receive recommendations.
Retailers: Upload garment specifications and 3D models, track customer engagement, and analyze trends.
Support Teams: Address user complaints about inaccuracies or technical issues with the virtual fitting feature.
2. Functional Requirements
Core Features:

Customer Avatars: Create virtual models using uploaded measurements, photos, or AI-generated estimates.
3D Garment Models: Retailers upload high-resolution 3D garment data to the system.
Fitting Simulation: AI simulates garment fitting in real-time based on customer avatars.
Product Recommendations: Suggest similar or complementary products based on user preferences and fit data.
Order Management: Standard features for adding items to carts, managing purchases, and tracking orders.
Authentication Conditions & Frequency:

Session-based Authentication: Requires login once per session, expiring after 12 hours of inactivity.
Sensitive Actions Requiring Re-authentication: Making payments or modifying saved body measurements.
Sensitivity of Actions & Permission Levels:

Customers: Access and modify personal profiles and avatars.
Retailers: Manage product data and view analytics dashboards.
Administrators: Oversee system performance, troubleshoot issues, and manage security.
3. Non-Functional Requirements
Performance:

Response time for fitting simulations should not exceed 5 seconds under normal conditions.
The platform must support up to 50,000 concurrent users during peak times.
Scalability:

Infrastructure must scale to accommodate a 10x growth in user base within two years, maintaining response times and simulation accuracy.
Reliability:

99.8% uptime with robust error recovery mechanisms for interrupted fitting simulations.
Security:

Encrypted storage of user measurement data and photos.
Rigorous access control to prevent unauthorized use of customer data.
Usability:

Intuitive interface with guided steps for creating avatars and exploring fitting simulations.
Mobile-optimized design ensuring consistent performance across devices.
Audit & Monitoring:

Comprehensive logs for fitting simulations, user uploads, and authentication events retained for 24 months.
Dashboards for administrators to monitor system health and user engagement.
4. Constraints
Technical Constraints:

Dependence on third-party APIs for AI processing and garment visualization.
High storage requirements for 3D models and user avatars, necessitating scalable cloud storage solutions.
Compliance Requirements:

GDPR compliance for handling user-uploaded photos and measurement data.
Consumer protection regulations in key markets for data transparency and return policies.
Resource Constraints:

Budget: $3.5 million for development, launch, and initial marketing efforts.
Team: 25 members, including AI specialists, backend developers, UX designers, QA engineers, and marketing professionals.
Timeline: 24 months for development, including a 4-month buffer for unforeseen delays.
Integration Needs:

Integration with existing e-commerce platforms (e.g., Shopify, Magento).
APIs to connect with third-party payment gateways and analytics tools.
This scenario is a feasible and distinct exploration of how advanced AI features can improve the e-commerce fashion industry while balancing technical and business requirements.
