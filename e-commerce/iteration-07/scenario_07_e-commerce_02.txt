E-Commerce System Requirements Scenario

1. System Overview
System Purpose:
The system is designed to support a marketplace platform that connects local artisans with global customers. It aims to streamline listing, transaction, and delivery processes while offering advanced customization for store branding and customer engagement tools.

Domain/Context:
E-commerce marketplace catering to niche sellers (e.g., artisans, small-scale manufacturers) seeking to expand their reach internationally while preserving the uniqueness of their products.

Stakeholders:

Primary Users: Artisans and small-scale sellers.
End Customers: Buyers seeking unique or custom products.
Platform Administrators: Internal team managing platform operations, fraud detection, and support.
Third-Party Partners: Logistics providers, payment processors, and marketing affiliates.
User Base Characteristics:

Approximately 5,000 artisans onboarded within the first 18 months, each managing individual stores with 20-50 products.
End customers primarily based in North America, Europe, and parts of Asia.
Roles include sellers (manage store content, inventory, and orders), customers (browse and purchase), and administrators (monitor platform health and compliance).
Operational Environment:

Cloud-based platform hosted on AWS with regional redundancies for high availability.
Accessible via web browsers and native mobile apps for iOS and Android.
Usage Scenarios:

Sellers: Listing products, managing inventory and orders, viewing sales analytics, and handling customer queries.
Buyers: Searching for products, customizing orders, completing purchases, and providing feedback.
Administrators: Approving new seller registrations, resolving disputes, and generating platform performance reports.
2. Functional Requirements
Core Features:

Seller Tools: Product listing templates, bulk import/export, and store branding customization.
Marketplace Features: Advanced search filters, category-based browsing, and a personalized recommendation engine.
Transaction Management: Integration with multiple payment processors and real-time order tracking.
Customer Support: Chat-based support for buyers and sellers, with an escalation process for unresolved issues.
Analytics Dashboard: Seller-specific insights (e.g., sales trends, traffic sources) and platform-wide metrics for administrators.
Authentication Conditions & Frequency:

Users authenticate at the beginning of each session.
Re-authentication required for sensitive actions such as payment setup, store closure, or refund approvals.
Sensitivity of Actions & Permission Levels:

High Sensitivity: Platform-wide reporting and policy changes (Admins only).
Medium Sensitivity: Product and pricing changes, order cancellations (Sellers).
Low Sensitivity: Product browsing, feedback submission (Buyers).
3. Non-Functional Requirements
Performance:

Page response times under 2 seconds for 95% of user requests.
Capable of handling 10,000 concurrent users during peak promotional campaigns.
Scalability:

Modular architecture to support a seller base growth of 300% over three years and traffic surges during global events like holiday sales.
Reliability:

99.95% uptime SLA, with automatic failover for key services and database backups every 10 minutes.
Security:

End-to-end encryption for all transactions.
Strict access controls and audit trails for sensitive operations.
Usability:

Localized interfaces for key regions (e.g., language support and regional currency display).
Simplified workflows for product uploads and order processing.
Audit & Monitoring:

Comprehensive tracking of all sensitive actions, including payment configuration and refund approvals.
Automated monitoring for fraud detection and anomaly alerts.
4. Constraints
Technical Constraints:

The platform must integrate with existing APIs for logistics (e.g., DHL, UPS) and payment gateways (e.g., PayPal, Stripe).
Backend services built using Node.js and hosted on AWS Lambda to ensure scalability.
Compliance Requirements:

GDPR compliance for European operations, including clear consent mechanisms and data portability.
PCI DSS compliance for payment processing.
Resource Constraints:

Initial budget of $3 million, with $750,000 reserved for scaling and post-launch enhancements.
Development timeline of 20 months, involving a team of 25 members (developers, designers, QA engineers, and compliance specialists).
Integration Needs:

Seamless integration with third-party authentication systems for Single Sign-On (SSO) compatibility with partner services.
This scenario reflects a realistic and industry-aligned approach to building an e-commerce marketplace tailored to artisans, accounting for potential scalability, compliance requirements, and robust operational capabilities.
