E-Commerce System Requirements Scenario

1. System Overview
System Purpose:
The system aims to develop a comprehensive e-commerce platform enabling small-to-medium-sized businesses (SMBs) to establish online storefronts. The platform will streamline product listing, inventory management, order processing, and customer engagement, while providing advanced analytics for business growth.

Domain/Context:
The e-commerce industry, specifically targeting SMBs that require scalable, user-friendly solutions to compete in an increasingly digital marketplace.

Stakeholders:

Primary Users: Business owners and their staff managing storefronts.
End Customers: Consumers purchasing products through the platform.
Administrators: Internal system operators ensuring platform functionality and compliance.
Third-Party Partners: Payment gateways, logistics providers, and analytics service providers.
User Base Characteristics:

Anticipated platform onboarding of 2,000 SMBs in the first year, each with 1-10 employees.
Geographic distribution: Primarily North America and Europe, expanding to Asia in subsequent phases.
Roles include store owners (admin-level access), staff (limited management rights), and end customers (purchase-only access).
Operational Environment:

Cloud-based solution hosted on a scalable infrastructure (AWS/Azure).
Accessible via web browsers and dedicated mobile apps (iOS/Android).
Usage Scenarios:

Business Owners: Listing products, managing inventory, processing orders, and generating reports.
Customers: Browsing storefronts, adding items to carts, completing purchases, and tracking orders.
Administrators: Monitoring system health, handling escalated support tickets, and enforcing compliance measures.
2. Functional Requirements
Core Features:

Product Management: Product upload with bulk import capabilities, categorization, and tagging.
Inventory Management: Real-time stock tracking and alerts for low inventory.
Order Processing: Integration with payment gateways and shipping services for seamless order fulfillment.
Customer Management: User account management, wish lists, and order history.
Analytics Dashboard: Insights into sales, traffic, and customer behavior.
Authentication Conditions & Frequency:

Users must authenticate at the start of every session.
Re-authentication is required for sensitive actions like payment gateway configuration, account settings changes, or administrative overrides.
Sensitivity of Actions & Permission Levels:

High Sensitivity: Payment configuration, user role management (Admin only).
Medium Sensitivity: Inventory updates, order cancellations (Admin and designated Staff).
Low Sensitivity: Product browsing, report viewing (All users).
3. Non-Functional Requirements
Performance:

Page load times must not exceed 2 seconds under normal traffic conditions.
Capable of handling up to 500 concurrent users per storefront during peak sales.
Scalability:

The system must support scaling to 10,000 SMBs and accommodate growth in customer traffic during promotional events like Black Friday.
Reliability:

99.9% uptime SLA, with automatic failover mechanisms for critical components.
Recovery from system failures within 5 minutes.
Security:

End-to-end data encryption for all transactions.
Role-based access controls to ensure minimal privilege.
Usability:

Intuitive interface with guided tutorials and localized content for different regions.
Mobile-first design to cater to a predominantly mobile user base.
Audit & Monitoring:

Comprehensive logging of all administrative actions and high-sensitivity operations.
Real-time dashboards for system activity and periodic compliance reporting.
4. Constraints
Technical Constraints:

Built on open-source technologies (e.g., React, Node.js) to minimize licensing costs.
Integration with existing logistics APIs (e.g., FedEx, UPS) and payment gateways (e.g., Stripe, PayPal).
Compliance Requirements:

GDPR compliance for European users, including consent mechanisms and data deletion requests.
PCI DSS compliance for handling payment card information.
Resource Constraints:

Initial budget of $2 million, with $500,000 allocated for scaling and maintenance.
Development timeline of 18 months, with a team of 20 comprising developers, designers, and QA engineers.
Integration Needs:

Seamless integration with third-party authentication systems for single sign-on (SSO) with partner platforms.
This scenario is designed to address the real-world challenges of an SMB-focused e-commerce platform while ensuring scalability, reliability, and compliance within realistic constraints.
