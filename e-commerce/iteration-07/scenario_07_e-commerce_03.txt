E-Commerce System Requirements Scenario

1. System Overview
System Purpose:
The system is a comprehensive e-commerce platform designed for subscription-based businesses. It supports the creation and management of recurring billing models, enabling businesses to offer subscription products, memberships, or services. The platform emphasizes automation, flexibility, and analytics to help businesses optimize their recurring revenue streams.

Domain/Context:
The e-commerce domain, specifically catering to subscription-based business models (e.g., software as a service, subscription boxes, and membership services).

Stakeholders:

Primary Users: Business owners and their teams who manage subscriptions and customer relationships.
End Customers: Individuals or organizations subscribing to products or services.
Platform Administrators: Internal personnel responsible for ensuring operational continuity and compliance.
Third-Party Providers: Payment processors, CRM systems, and marketing tools.
User Base Characteristics:

Anticipated 3,000 businesses onboarded in the first 24 months, with subscription bases ranging from 500 to 20,000 customers per business.
Global user base, with businesses and customers primarily located in North America, Europe, and Asia-Pacific regions.
Roles include business administrators (manage accounts, billing, and analytics), team members (support operations), and customers (manage subscriptions).
Operational Environment:

A cloud-based solution hosted on a scalable infrastructure (e.g., AWS, GCP) with global CDN support.
Accessible via web dashboards for businesses and responsive customer portals for end-users, with mobile app support for both platforms.
Usage Scenarios:

Business Owners: Setting up subscription tiers, configuring billing cycles, and viewing analytics.
Customers: Selecting subscription plans, updating payment methods, and managing account preferences.
Administrators: Monitoring platform uptime, resolving support tickets, and ensuring compliance with global regulations.
2. Functional Requirements
Core Features:

Subscription Management: Tools for creating, customizing, and automating recurring billing cycles, free trials, and discount offers.
Customer Portal: Allowing end customers to view and manage their subscriptions, payment details, and preferences.
Analytics and Reporting: Insights into churn rates, revenue growth, and customer retention metrics.
Billing Integrations: Seamless integration with major payment gateways (e.g., Stripe, PayPal) and support for multiple currencies.
Support Tools: Built-in communication channels for businesses to assist customers with subscription queries.
Authentication Conditions & Frequency:

Users authenticate at the start of each session.
Re-authentication required for sensitive operations, such as updating billing configurations, accessing analytics, or changing payment methods.
Sensitivity of Actions & Permission Levels:

High Sensitivity: Billing system configurations, user role management (Admins only).
Medium Sensitivity: Creating or modifying subscription plans, processing refunds (Admins and team members).
Low Sensitivity: Viewing subscription details, exporting reports (Admins and team members).
3. Non-Functional Requirements
Performance:

Page response times under 1.5 seconds for 95% of user interactions.
Support for 50,000 concurrent users across all businesses during peak hours.
Scalability:

The platform must scale to accommodate 10,000 businesses and 5 million end customers within 5 years.
Reliability:

99.95% uptime SLA, with automatic failover for billing services and hourly backups of customer and transaction data.
Security:

All data must be encrypted at rest and in transit.
Role-based access controls and comprehensive logging for sensitive actions.
Usability:

Localized interfaces supporting at least five major languages (e.g., English, Spanish, French, German, Mandarin).
Simplified workflows for setting up subscriptions and managing customer accounts.
Audit & Monitoring:

Logging of all transactions, billing events, and user actions for a minimum of 5 years.
Real-time monitoring dashboards for administrators to identify performance bottlenecks or potential compliance violations.
4. Constraints
Technical Constraints:

Backend services developed in Python and deployed on a serverless architecture to optimize costs.
Integration with at least five major payment gateways and regional payment options.
Compliance Requirements:

GDPR and CCPA compliance for customer data handling and privacy.
PCI DSS compliance for payment processing and storage of sensitive data.
Resource Constraints:

Initial development budget of $4 million, including $1 million for compliance and scaling needs post-launch.
Development timeline of 22 months, with a team of 30 members comprising developers, UI/UX designers, compliance experts, and QA engineers.
Integration Needs:

Seamless integration with third-party CRM tools (e.g., Salesforce, HubSpot) and marketing platforms (e.g., Mailchimp).
This scenario reflects a realistic approach to creating a subscription-based e-commerce platform, addressing business needs, technical constraints, and compliance challenges with conservative resource estimates and detailed functional and non-functional requirements.
