User Base Characteristics:

Size: Initial user base of 30,000 active monthly users, projected to grow by 15% annually.
Diversity: Vendors and customers from urban and suburban areas, primarily in North America and Asia-Pacific regions.
Roles: Customers, vendors, delivery service representatives, and administrators.
Operational Environment:

A cloud-based platform accessible via web and mobile applications.

Performance:

The platform should deliver page responses under 1.5 seconds for 90% of user requests.
Must handle up to 1,000 concurrent transactions during peak traffic.
Scalability:

Scalable to support a 15% annual increase in user base and transaction volume without performance degradation.
Reliability:

Target system uptime of 99.8%, with the ability to recover critical operations within 10 minutes of a failure.
Security:

All transactions and sensitive user data are encrypted in transit and at rest.
Role-based access control to ensure data privacy and restrict unauthorized access.

Compliance Requirements:

GDPR compliance for data privacy, particularly for customers in the EU.
PCI DSS compliance for handling payment transactions securely.
Resource Constraints:

Initial development budget of $1.5 million with a delivery timeframe of 10 months.
Team of 8 developers, 1 UX designer, 2 QA engineers, and 1 project manager.
Integration Needs:
