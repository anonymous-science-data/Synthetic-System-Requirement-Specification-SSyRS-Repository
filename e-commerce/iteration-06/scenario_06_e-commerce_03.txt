E-Commerce System Requirements Scenario
1. System Overview
System Purpose:
The system will serve as a subscription-based e-commerce platform for specialty food and beverage products. It allows customers to order curated, customizable subscription boxes while enabling vendors to showcase unique offerings.

Domain/Context:
The platform operates within the gourmet food and beverage e-commerce sector, catering to customers looking for specialty and artisanal products.

Stakeholders:

Customers: Individuals subscribing to curated boxes and purchasing individual items.
Vendors: Artisanal food and beverage producers listing their products.
Platform Administrators: Oversee platform compliance and manage operations.
Logistics Partners: Handle packaging, shipping, and delivery of subscription boxes.
User Base Characteristics:

Size: Approximately 20,000 active monthly users at launch, projected to grow by 30% annually.
Diversity: Users are predominantly from urban areas in North America and Europe, with a focus on high-income, food-savvy demographics.
Roles: Customers, vendors, logistics partners, and administrators.
Operational Environment:

Cloud-based platform accessible via desktop and mobile applications.
High availability required during subscription renewal periods and promotional campaigns.
Usage Scenarios:

Customers select subscription plans, customize their boxes, and explore individual product offerings.
Vendors upload product information, manage inventory, and track sales performance.
Logistics partners access order details and provide real-time updates on delivery status.
Administrators manage vendor compliance, customer disputes, and performance reports.
2. Functional Requirements
Core Features:

Subscription management for recurring deliveries, including customization of box contents.
Vendor dashboards for product uploads, inventory tracking, and sales analytics.
Secure payment processing with support for subscriptions and one-time purchases.
Real-time inventory updates to prevent overselling.
Automated reminders for subscription renewals and box customizations.
Order tracking and delivery notifications.
Customer reviews and feedback on individual products and overall subscriptions.
Authentication Conditions & Frequency:

Customers authenticate at session start, with sessions lasting 7 days unless manually logged out. Re-authentication is required for sensitive actions like payment updates.
Vendors re-authenticate every 12 hours of inactivity.
Administrators must authenticate at each session and re-authenticate for critical actions like user data access or dispute resolutions.
Logistics partners authenticate daily, with re-authentication required after session expiration.
Sensitivity of Actions & Permission Levels:

Customers: Managing subscription preferences and payment details (medium sensitivity).
Vendors: Managing inventory, sales data, and order tracking (high sensitivity).
Logistics partners: Updating delivery statuses (low sensitivity).
Administrators: Accessing all platform data and managing compliance (high sensitivity).
3. Non-Functional Requirements
Performance:

Pages must load within 2 seconds for 90% of user interactions.
Capable of handling up to 500 concurrent transactions during peak renewal periods.
Scalability:

The platform must support 30% annual growth in user base and subscription volume without performance degradation.
Reliability:

99.9% uptime with automatic failover mechanisms. Critical functions (e.g., payment processing) must recover within 5 minutes of failure.
Security:

All data is encrypted in transit and at rest. Role-based access control ensures proper permissions for all user roles.
Usability:

Designed with a mobile-first approach, ensuring intuitive navigation for customers and vendors.
Compliance with WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility standards.
Audit & Monitoring:

Detailed logging of subscription changes, payment transactions, and sensitive administrative actions.
Regular automated reports for security and compliance reviews.
4. Constraints
Technical Constraints:

Serverless architecture using AWS services (e.g., Lambda, S3, RDS) for cost efficiency and scalability.
Use of PostgreSQL for transactional data and Amazon Elasticsearch for search functionality.
Compliance Requirements:

GDPR compliance for EU customers, ensuring transparency and user data control.
PCI DSS compliance for secure payment processing.
Resource Constraints:

Development budget capped at $2 million with a 12-month delivery timeline.
A team of 10 developers, 2 UX designers, 2 QA engineers, and 1 project manager.
Integration Needs:

Integration with third-party payment processors (e.g., Stripe, PayPal).
API integration with logistics providers for real-time shipping updates.
This scenario is tailored to address the specific needs of a subscription-based e-commerce platform, balancing technical and business requirements with realistic constraints and scalability goals.
