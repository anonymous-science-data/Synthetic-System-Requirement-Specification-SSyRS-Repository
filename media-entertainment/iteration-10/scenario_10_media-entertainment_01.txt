1. System Overview

System Purpose:
To create an AI-powered Media Content Personalization and Licensing Platform designed to streamline content discovery for global media distribution networks. The system will leverage AI to recommend and license digital media (movies, TV shows, and music) based on viewer preferences, geographic licensing restrictions, and real-time market demand analytics.

Domain/Context:
Media and Entertainment domain, with a focus on digital content distribution, licensing, and personalized recommendations for broadcasters, OTT (Over-the-Top) platforms, and regional distributors.

Stakeholders:

    Global Broadcasters and OTT Platforms: Use the system to discover, license, and distribute content.
    Regional Distributors: Utilize the platform for localized licensing of content.
    Content Creators/Studios: List their media assets for global discovery and monetization.
    Viewers (Indirect Stakeholders): Benefit from personalized recommendations on OTT platforms driven by system algorithms.
    Internal Administrators: Oversee content ingestion, AI algorithms, and licensing workflows.

User Base Characteristics:

    Size: Approximately 10,000 concurrent users globally, with scalability for up to 50,000 users during peak licensing periods (e.g., major sporting events or award seasons).
    Diversity: Includes content curators, acquisition managers, legal teams, administrators, and data scientists.
    Geographic Distribution: Users span North America, Europe, Asia-Pacific, and Latin America.
    Roles: Content Curators, Licensing Managers, System Administrators, Legal & Compliance Officers.

Operational Environment:

    Hosting: Cloud-based solution leveraging a multi-region architecture for low latency and high availability.
    Access: Web-based application with support for desktop and mobile browsers, optimized for both corporate and remote work environments.

Usage Scenarios:

    A licensing manager searches for content within a specific genre and region, applies licensing filters, and selects titles to acquire rights for streaming in their country.
    A content curator uploads and categorizes new media assets for global distribution, inputting metadata for AI-driven recommendations.
    Administrators analyze licensing trends through dashboards, identifying high-performing genres or regions.
    Legal teams review and approve licensing agreements before finalization.

2. Functional Requirements

Core Features:

    AI-driven content recommendation engine tailored to user preferences and market trends.
    Search and filtering options for content based on genre, licensing availability, region, and format.
    Content metadata ingestion with automated tagging and categorization.
    Real-time licensing dashboard with performance analytics.
    Automated generation of licensing contracts with configurable templates.

Authentication Conditions & Frequency:

    Session Expiration: After 60 minutes of inactivity.
    Sensitive Actions: Re-authentication required for executing or approving high-value licensing agreements.

Sensitivity of Actions & Permission Levels:

    High Sensitivity: Approving licensing contracts (requires Licensing Manager or Legal Officer roles).
    Moderate Sensitivity: Modifying metadata or content availability (requires Content Curator role).
    Low Sensitivity: Browsing and filtering content (accessible to all authenticated users).

3. Non-Functional Requirements

Performance:

    Average response time of <1 second for searches.
    Content ingestion and metadata processing to complete within 5 minutes per asset.

Scalability:

    Scalable infrastructure to handle up to 50,000 concurrent users during peak demand.
    Dynamic scaling to process large metadata ingestion spikes (up to 10,000 assets per hour).

Reliability:

    99.9% uptime SLA with automated failover mechanisms.
    Recovery from critical failures within 15 minutes using backup services.

Security:

    End-to-end encryption for data in transit and at rest.
    Role-based access controls (RBAC) with fine-grained permissions.
    Regular penetration testing and vulnerability assessments.

Usability:

    Intuitive interface with minimal clicks required for common actions.
    Multilingual support for five major languages (English, Spanish, French, Mandarin, Hindi).
    Accessibility compliance with WCAG 2.1 AA standards.

Audit & Monitoring:

    Detailed logging of user actions, especially for licensing approvals.
    Real-time monitoring dashboards for system performance and usage trends.
    Monthly audit reports on content transactions and user activities.

4. Constraints

Technical Constraints:

    Must support integration with existing DRM (Digital Rights Management) systems used by content creators.
    Limited to a hybrid AI model approach (cloud-based inference combined with edge-device optimization for search responsiveness).

Compliance Requirements:

    Adherence to GDPR for users in Europe, including right-to-access and right-to-delete features.
    Compliance with U.S. DMCA and regional licensing laws.

Resource Constraints:

    Budget: $15 million for development and deployment, including infrastructure and third-party service subscriptions.
    Timeline: 18 months to full production, with a 3-month buffer for testing and refinements.
    Team Size: 50-person cross-functional team including software engineers, AI/ML experts, legal consultants, and UX designers.

Integration Needs:

    Seamless integration with third-party payment processors for licensing transactions.
    API connections to major OTT platforms for direct content syncing and updates.
