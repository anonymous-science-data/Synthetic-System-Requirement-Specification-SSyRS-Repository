1. System Overview

System Purpose:
To develop an AI-driven Content Localization and Quality Control (CLQC) Platform for the Media and Entertainment industry. The system will streamline the process of translating, dubbing, subtitling, and quality-checking media content (movies, TV shows, and online videos) for international distribution, ensuring compliance with regional standards and audience preferences.

Domain/Context:
Media localization and distribution within the Media and Entertainment industry, catering to studios, broadcasters, and OTT platforms aiming to reach global audiences with culturally adapted content.

Stakeholders:

    Content Studios: Use the platform to localize and prepare media for international release.
    Localization Vendors: Provide translation, subtitling, and dubbing services through the platform.
    OTT Platforms: Ensure localized content meets audience expectations and regulatory compliance in target regions.
    Internal Administrators: Manage workflows, review quality, and oversee localization metrics.

User Base Characteristics:

    Size: 1,000â€“3,000 concurrent users, scalable to 5,000 users during peak localization cycles (e.g., global film releases).
    Diversity: Includes translators, quality control specialists, localization project managers, content reviewers, and administrators.
    Geographic Distribution: Users spread across North America, Europe, Asia, and Latin America, representing key markets for media consumption.
    Roles: Translation specialists, dubbing artists, compliance reviewers, and localization managers.

Operational Environment:

    Hosting: Cloud-based with regional hosting zones to ensure low latency for geographically distributed teams.
    Access: Web-based interface with mobile access for reviewing subtitled content on the go.

Usage Scenarios:

    A translator uploads subtitle files for a film, and the system automatically flags potential inconsistencies such as text overlaps or out-of-sync timestamps.
    A dubbing artist uses AI-generated voice guides to match their performance with the original actors' lip movements.
    A localization manager reviews flagged quality issues via an interactive dashboard and assigns tasks to specific team members.
    A compliance officer checks the localized content against regional regulatory standards and confirms approval for release.

2. Functional Requirements

Core Features:

    AI-driven translation suggestions with contextual and cultural relevance checks.
    Automated subtitling and lip-syncing tools for dubbing, leveraging speech recognition and synthesis.
    Real-time quality assurance tools to flag issues like text overlaps, incorrect timing, or formatting errors.
    Centralized dashboard for project tracking, task assignments, and localization status reporting.
    Region-specific compliance checks with customizable workflows.

Authentication Conditions & Frequency:

    Session Expiration: Sessions expire after 60 minutes of inactivity to maintain security.
    Sensitive Actions: Re-authentication required for tasks such as approving final localized content or exporting localized assets.

Sensitivity of Actions & Permission Levels:

    High Sensitivity: Approving final localized content (requires Localization Manager or Compliance Officer roles).
    Moderate Sensitivity: Uploading subtitle or audio files for localization (requires Translator or Dubbing Artist roles).
    Low Sensitivity: Viewing assigned tasks and commenting on flagged issues (open to all team members).

3. Non-Functional Requirements

Performance:

    Subtitle synchronization and AI-assisted translation suggestions delivered within 2 seconds per query.
    Processing of localization assets (e.g., subtitles or audio tracks) for a 60-minute video completed within 10 minutes.

Scalability:

    Designed to handle up to 5,000 concurrent users and process 10,000 localization tasks per day during peak load.

Reliability:

    99.9% uptime SLA with multi-region redundancy to avoid service disruptions.
    Data recovery mechanisms to restore localization projects within 15 minutes after a critical failure.

Security:

    End-to-end encryption for content in transit and at rest.
    Fine-grained role-based access control (RBAC) for managing content and workflows.

Usability:

    Intuitive drag-and-drop interface for uploading media and localization files.
    Support for multi-language interfaces, including English, Spanish, Japanese, and Arabic.
    Mobile-friendly design for compliance reviews and on-the-go task management.

Audit & Monitoring:

    Comprehensive logs of user actions, particularly for tasks involving content approvals and exports.
    Real-time monitoring of system health and usage patterns to identify bottlenecks.
    Monthly audit reports available for internal and external compliance purposes.

4. Constraints

Technical Constraints:

    Restricted to using cloud providers that support GPU-accelerated AI processing for translation and voice synthesis.
    Maximum file upload size of 2GB per video to balance processing efficiency and resource availability.

Compliance Requirements:

    GDPR compliance for all user data and content distributed in the EU.
    Adherence to local content censorship and language-specific regulations in target regions (e.g., China, India, Saudi Arabia).

Resource Constraints:

    Budget: $12 million allocated for system development and deployment over two years.
    Timeline: 18 months to achieve production readiness, with a 6-month buffer for refinements.
    Team Size: 60-person team, including AI/ML experts, software developers, project managers, and compliance specialists.

Integration Needs:

    APIs for integrating with third-party localization tools (e.g., SDL Trados, MemoQ).
    Compatibility with DRM systems used by major OTT platforms for secure content distribution.
