1. System Overview

System Purpose:
To develop a Cloud-Based Collaborative Media Production Platform designed to enable remote teams of media professionals (e.g., video editors, sound designers, and producers) to work on high-resolution media projects seamlessly. The system will provide centralized media storage, real-time collaboration tools, and integrated version control to streamline the production process for film, television, and digital content creation.

Domain/Context:
Media and Entertainment domain, specifically targeting post-production workflows for large-scale media projects such as feature films, episodic television, and high-quality digital content for OTT platforms.

Stakeholders:

    Production Studios: Manage collaborative projects with distributed teams.
    Freelancers: Contribute specialized work (e.g., visual effects, sound engineering).
    Producers: Oversee project progress and review deliverables.
    System Administrators: Maintain platform reliability, performance, and data security.

User Base Characteristics:

    Size: 2,000â€“5,000 concurrent users, with scalability for up to 10,000 users during peak production seasons.
    Diversity: Includes editors, sound designers, visual effects artists, producers, and system administrators.
    Geographic Distribution: Primarily North America and Europe, with a growing presence in Asia-Pacific.
    Roles: Creative professionals, project managers, and administrators.

Operational Environment:

    Hosting: Fully cloud-based using multi-region architecture for global access and low latency.
    Access: Web and desktop applications with offline editing capabilities and seamless cloud synchronization.

Usage Scenarios:

    A video editor uploads raw 8K footage, performs frame-by-frame edits, and collaborates in real-time with a sound designer.
    A producer reviews a work-in-progress cut, leaves timestamped comments, and requests revisions.
    A team leader manages access permissions for team members, ensuring only relevant individuals can access sensitive footage.
    Automated version control captures every change, enabling a seamless rollback if errors are detected.

2. Functional Requirements

Core Features:

    Centralized high-resolution media storage with optimized access for 4K and 8K content.
    Real-time collaboration tools (e.g., shared editing sessions, timestamped commenting).
    Advanced version control with branching and rollback functionality.
    Integrated rendering engine to offload processing to cloud infrastructure.
    Permission management for granular access control over project files and media assets.

Authentication Conditions & Frequency:

    Session Expiration: Sessions expire after 90 minutes of inactivity to preserve system resources.
    Sensitive Actions: Re-authentication required before deleting or permanently archiving media assets.

Sensitivity of Actions & Permission Levels:

    High Sensitivity: Deleting, archiving, or exporting final project files (requires Administrator or Project Manager roles).
    Moderate Sensitivity: Uploading new media assets (requires Editor or Team Member roles).
    Low Sensitivity: Viewing media files and leaving comments (open to all team members).

3. Non-Functional Requirements

Performance:

    Uploads for 8K footage (<5 minutes per GB) with real-time streaming capabilities.
    Rendering times reduced by 40% using cloud-based processing.

Scalability:

    Support for up to 10,000 concurrent users with dynamic resource allocation for peak workloads.

Reliability:

    99.95% uptime SLA with automated failover mechanisms.
    Data redundancy across three regions to ensure no loss of critical media assets.

Security:

    End-to-end encryption for media assets in transit and at rest.
    Role-based access control (RBAC) to ensure sensitive files are only accessible to authorized users.

Usability:

    Intuitive drag-and-drop interfaces for uploading and managing media.
    Full accessibility compliance with WCAG 2.1 AA standards.
    Multilingual support for English, Spanish, Mandarin, and German.

Audit & Monitoring:

    Detailed logs of user actions (e.g., file uploads, edits, and exports).
    Real-time monitoring for unusual activity (e.g., excessive downloads or access from multiple regions).
    Weekly audit reports available for system administrators.

4. Constraints

Technical Constraints:

    Limited to cloud providers offering GPU-enabled virtual machines for rendering.
    Maximum file upload size capped at 500GB per file to manage resource consumption.

Compliance Requirements:

    GDPR compliance for European users, including data residency controls.
    Adherence to MPAA (Motion Picture Association of America) content security best practices.

Resource Constraints:

    Budget: $20 million allocated for development, deployment, and operational costs over two years.
    Timeline: 24 months to production readiness, with a 6-month buffer for post-launch optimization.
    Team Size: 75-person team, including cloud architects, software developers, UI/UX designers, and compliance specialists.

Integration Needs:

    Integration with existing creative tools like Adobe Premiere Pro and Avid Media Composer.
    APIs for connecting with DRM systems and third-party storage solutions.
