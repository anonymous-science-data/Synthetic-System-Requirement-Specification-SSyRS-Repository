User Base Characteristics:

Size: Medium to large teams, ranging from 50 to 500 users per organization.
Diversity: Multidisciplinary teams spanning different time zones, including internal staff and external collaborators.
Geographic Distribution: Predominantly urban, distributed globally to support decentralized production workflows.
Roles: Editors, producers, project managers, administrators, and external reviewers.
Operational Environment:

Cloud-hosted platform accessible via web browsers and mobile apps.
Integrated with popular creative software (e.g., Adobe Creative Cloud, DaVinci Resolve).
Mobile access for reviewers and approval workflows.
Usage Scenarios:

A video editor uploads raw footage for post-production, sharing edits in real-time with collaborators.
A producer assigns tasks, monitors progress, and provides feedback on ongoing projects.
Marketing teams access approved assets for use in campaigns.
Freelancers submit final deliverables via secure links with temporary access.
2. Functional Requirements
Core Features:

Real-time Collaboration: Simultaneous editing, commenting, and feedback on media files.
Asset Management: Centralized repository with version control and tagging for quick searches.

Approval Workflows: Automated workflows for content review and approval.
File Sharing: Secure and seamless sharing of large media files with internal and external users.
Authentication Conditions & Frequency:

Session Authentication: Required at the start of each session; sessions expire after 8 hours of inactivity.
Sensitive Actions: Re-authentication required for approving final edits, accessing restricted projects, or downloading confidential files.
Sensitivity of Actions & Permission Levels:

Producers: Can approve final edits, assign roles, and manage permissions.
Editors: Full access to assigned projects but restricted from changing team settings.
Clients/Reviewers: Limited access for providing feedback and approvals only.
3. Non-Functional Requirements
Performance:

Response time for loading assets must not exceed 3 seconds under normal conditions.
File uploads must support speeds of up to 1 GB per minute, with progress indicators.
Scalability:

Must support up to 10,000 concurrent users with minimal performance degradation.
Designed to handle up to 50 TB of media storage per organization.
Reliability:

99.9% uptime, with automated backups performed every 4 hours.
Disaster recovery in under 30 minutes for critical failures.
Security:

End-to-end encryption for all stored and transmitted data.
Role-based access control (RBAC) for permissions.
Activity logs for all access and edits to ensure auditability.
Usability:

Intuitive user interface with customizable dashboards for different roles.
Accessibility features including screen reader compatibility and keyboard navigation.
Audit & Monitoring:

Comprehensive logs of user actions, including authentication attempts and approvals.
Real-time alerts for suspicious activities such as multiple failed login attempts.
4. Constraints
Technical Constraints:

Requires compatibility with standard creative tools (e.g., Adobe, DaVinci Resolve).
Designed to operate on browsers supporting HTML5, with no dependency on plug-ins.
Compliance Requirements:

Must comply with GDPR for data protection, especially for EU-based organizations.
Adherence to MPAA Content Security Best Practices for handling media assets.
Resource Constraints:

Budget: $5 million allocated over two years for development, testing, and deployment.
Staffing: Core team of 20, including developers, QA engineers, and UX designers, supported by 5 project managers and compliance specialists.
Time: 18-month development timeline, with a 6-month buffer for unforeseen delays.
Integration Needs:

Integration with Single Sign-On (SSO) solutions already used by client organizations.
APIs for syncing with popular project management tools (e.g., Trello, Asana).
This scenario represents a robust, scalable solution for collaborative media production, balancing functional requirements with realistic constraints and resource allocation.
