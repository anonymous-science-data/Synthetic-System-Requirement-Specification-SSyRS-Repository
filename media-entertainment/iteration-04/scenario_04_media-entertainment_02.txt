Media and Entertainment System Scenario
1. System Overview
System Purpose:
The system, called ContentBridge Pro, is designed to optimize the workflows of post-production teams by providing an integrated platform for managing video editing, audio synchronization, and VFX approvals. Its primary objective is to reduce the time from production to distribution by automating repetitive tasks, streamlining collaboration, and maintaining a central repository for media assets.

Domain/Context:
The system operates in the Media and Entertainment domain, specifically targeting post-production facilities for films, television, and online video platforms.

Stakeholders:

Post-Production Supervisors: Oversee project timelines and ensure quality.
Editors: Use the platform for video editing and reviewing.
Sound Engineers: Manage and sync audio assets.
VFX Artists: Submit and review visual effects for approval.
Production Studios: Monitor progress and provide approvals.
User Base Characteristics:

Size: Approximately 2,000 active users during the initial rollout, scaling to 8,000 users across multiple studios.
Diversity: Users vary in skill level, from junior editors to experienced supervisors.
Geographic Distribution: Predominantly North America and Europe, with plans to expand to Asia-Pacific.
Roles: Editors, VFX artists, sound engineers, supervisors, and studio executives.
2. Functional Requirements
Core Features:

Asset Management: Centralized storage and version control for video, audio, and effects files.
Automated Workflow Tools: Tasks such as format conversion, color grading presets, and transcoding automation.
Real-Time Collaboration: Shared timelines, comment threads, and live feedback for editing teams.
Approval Tracking: Automated notifications for approvals or requested changes from supervisors.
Integration with Editing Software: Direct plugin support for popular tools like Adobe Premiere, Final Cut Pro, and Avid Media Composer.
Frequency of Authentication:
Users authenticate once per session, with additional authentication required for accessing secure project files or approving final cuts.

Sensitivity of Actions:

High Sensitivity: Final approvals, export of mastered files, and deletion of project assets (requires multi-factor authentication).
Moderate Sensitivity: File uploads, edits, and sharing within teams (requires role-based access).
3. Non-Functional Requirements
Performance:

Video asset uploads must complete within 30 seconds for files up to 5GB.
System must support real-time collaboration for up to 50 simultaneous users per project without latency exceeding 300ms.
Scalability:
Designed to handle a 4x increase in active users and a 10x growth in storage demands over five years.

Reliability:

Minimum uptime of 99.8%.
Full recovery of files and workflows within 10 minutes in case of a server outage.
Security:

End-to-end encryption for all project files.
Regular audits to comply with Motion Picture Association (MPA) guidelines.
Role-based access control to segregate permissions.
Usability:

Intuitive interfaces with contextual tooltips for novice users.
Support for dark mode and color-blind friendly design options.
4. Constraints
Technical Constraints:

System hosted on hybrid cloud infrastructure to balance performance and cost.
Integration with existing studio authentication systems (e.g., SAML-based SSO).
Compliance Requirements:

Compliance with GDPR and CCPA for data privacy.
Adherence to the MPA's "Content Security Best Practices" guidelines.
Resource Constraints:

Budget: $3M for development, with annual maintenance costs not exceeding $1.5M.
Staffing: A team of 15 developers, 2 UI/UX designers, and 2 quality assurance engineers.
Timeline: Full deployment within 18 months, with a beta release in 12 months.
Integration Needs:

Compatibility with industry-standard tools such as Adobe, Autodesk, and DaVinci Resolve.
Seamless integration with digital asset management systems already in use by studios.
