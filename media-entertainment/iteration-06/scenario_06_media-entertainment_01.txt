Scenario: Content Licensing and Distribution Management System

1. System Overview
System Purpose:
To enable seamless management, tracking, and distribution of content licenses for a global media company, ensuring accurate royalty calculations, license compliance, and content accessibility for various partners and distributors.

Domain/Context:
Media and Entertainment, specifically focused on content licensing and rights management for digital media assets, including films, TV shows, music, and digital formats like streaming.

Stakeholders:

Internal Users: Licensing managers, legal teams, finance teams.
External Users: Distribution partners (e.g., OTT platforms, broadcasters), content creators, and rights holders.
IT Teams: Responsible for deploying, maintaining, and securing the system.
Executives: Seeking performance metrics and compliance reports.
User Base Characteristics:

Size: Approximately 5,000 global users.
Diversity: Includes partners from multiple regions with different licensing and regulatory requirements.
Geographic Distribution: Users are spread across North America, Europe, Asia, and Latin America.
Roles: Admins (e.g., superusers managing system configurations), Licensing Analysts, Finance Specialists, Legal Teams, and external partners with limited access.
Operational Environment:
A cloud-based platform accessible via web and mobile applications, optimized for secure remote access, with dedicated support for integration into existing enterprise systems.

Usage Scenarios:

A licensing manager enters a new distribution agreement with terms (e.g., geographical restrictions, revenue shares).
An external OTT partner downloads approved content and license metadata for their platform.
Finance teams generate royalty reports based on consumption data.
Legal teams review compliance with regional licensing laws.
2. Functional Requirements

Automated royalty calculation based on consumption and distribution terms.
Partner-specific dashboards showing available content and license terms.
Advanced search functionality for licenses by region, date, and type.
Integration with content delivery networks (CDNs) for automated distribution.
Authentication Conditions & Frequency:

Users authenticate at the start of each session.
Sensitive actions (e.g., updating license terms, exporting financial data) require re-authentication.
Sessions expire after 60 minutes of inactivity.
Sensitivity of Actions & Permission Levels:

High Sensitivity: Editing license agreements (Admins, Licensing Managers).
Moderate Sensitivity: Viewing license data (Licensing Analysts, Legal Teams).
Low Sensitivity: Accessing content delivery dashboards (External Partners).
3. Non-Functional Requirements

System must process licensing queries within 2 seconds.
Able to handle up to 10,000 concurrent users with no noticeable degradation.
Scalability:

Elastic cloud architecture to support seasonal increases in usage (e.g., during major content launches).
Reliability:

99.9% uptime SLA.
Automated failover and recovery mechanisms for critical components.
Security:

End-to-end encryption for data in transit and at rest.
Role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict data access.
Multi-layer intrusion detection and prevention systems.
Usability:

Intuitive interface with localization for at least 10 languages.
Mobile-friendly design for licensing managers and partners on the go.
Audit & Monitoring:

Comprehensive logging of user actions, especially for sensitive operations.
Real-time monitoring dashboards for system admins.
4. Constraints
Technical Constraints:

Must be compatible with existing enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems and CDNs.
Requires integration with third-party analytics tools for royalty calculations.
Compliance Requirements:

Adherence to GDPR for EU users, including stringent data retention policies.
Compliance with industry standards like MPAA guidelines for digital content security.
Resource Constraints:

Development budget capped at $2.5 million.
Six-month timeline for MVP delivery.
Integration Needs:

Seamless API integration with major OTT platforms and existing financial systems.
This scenario balances realistic constraints with an achievable scope, addressing specific challenges in the Media and Entertainment domain while aligning with typical industry requirements.
