Scenario: Streaming Content Quality Analytics and Optimization System

1. System Overview
System Purpose:
To provide advanced analytics and optimization for streaming media platforms, enabling real-time monitoring of content quality, viewer experience, and delivery performance, while offering actionable insights to improve streaming efficiency.

Domain/Context:
Media and Entertainment, specifically catering to the growing needs of Over-the-Top (OTT) streaming platforms and content delivery networks (CDNs).

Stakeholders:

Internal Users: Streaming platform operators, content delivery engineers, and quality assurance teams.
External Users: Content creators and licensing partners interested in performance metrics.
Executives: Seeking strategic insights on viewership trends and service performance.
IT Administrators: Managing platform deployment and infrastructure.
User Base Characteristics:

Size: Approximately 10,000 global users, primarily technical and managerial staff.
Diversity: Includes users from technical (network engineers) and strategic (executives) roles.
Geographic Distribution: Highly distributed user base spanning multiple continents, supporting diverse network conditions.
Roles: Admins (full access), Operators (quality monitoring), Analysts (data insights), External Partners (limited access to relevant reports).
Operational Environment:
A cloud-based, web-accessible system with mobile app support for real-time updates. The system integrates with existing CDNs and analytics platforms, ensuring compatibility with hybrid on-premise and cloud infrastructures.

Usage Scenarios:

A streaming operator monitors real-time metrics for a new content release and adjusts server allocations to avoid congestion.
An analyst generates reports on viewer buffering rates and content abandonment trends to identify potential delivery issues.
An executive reviews historical performance data to strategize content acquisitions for specific regions.
External partners access limited analytics on their licensed content to assess performance in different regions.
2. Functional Requirements
Core Features:

Real-time analytics dashboards for monitoring buffering rates, latency, and server health.
Historical data analysis and customizable reporting for key performance indicators (KPIs).
Predictive analytics to forecast demand spikes and recommend preemptive measures.
Automated alerts for critical issues, such as server outages or abnormal viewer dropout rates.
Geo-specific performance insights to identify regional delivery bottlenecks.
Authentication Conditions & Frequency:

Users authenticate at the beginning of each session.
Sensitive actions, such as modifying server allocations or accessing raw user data, require re-authentication.
Sessions expire after 120 minutes of inactivity.
Sensitivity of Actions & Permission Levels:

High Sensitivity: Modifying server allocations or data configurations (Admins).
Moderate Sensitivity: Accessing viewer metrics and trend analysis (Operators, Analysts).
Low Sensitivity: Viewing content-specific performance reports (External Partners).
3. Non-Functional Requirements
Performance:

Real-time dashboards must update metrics within 1 second of data receipt.
The system must support processing of 100,000 concurrent streams with no latency in analytics.
Scalability:

Designed to scale dynamically during peak streaming times, such as global premieres or sports events.
Reliability:

99.9% uptime SLA.
Automated failover mechanisms for data ingestion and reporting services.
Security:

Strict role-based access control with encryption of all analytics data in transit and at rest.
Continuous vulnerability scanning and regular penetration tests.
Usability:

Interactive and intuitive dashboards with customizable layouts.
Mobile-friendly interface for operators on the move.
Audit & Monitoring:

Comprehensive logs of user activities, especially for sensitive actions like data exports.
Alerts for unusual authentication patterns or access attempts.
4. Constraints
Technical Constraints:

Must integrate seamlessly with leading CDNs and analytics solutions, including Akamai, AWS CloudFront, and Google Analytics.
Requires support for high-resolution real-time data visualization without impacting performance.
Compliance Requirements:

Adherence to GDPR for EU viewers' data protection.
Compliance with industry standards for video quality metrics, such as CTA WAVE standards.
Resource Constraints:

Budget of $3 million for initial development and deployment.
Delivery timeline of 10 months for a fully operational system.
Integration Needs:

API integration with third-party streaming platforms for ingesting performance data.
Compatibility with enterprise Single Sign-On (SSO) systems for authentication.
This scenario is realistic, addressing the specific challenges and needs of OTT streaming platforms while aligning with the technical and business constraints of the Media and Entertainment sector. It ensures a balance between ambitious features and practical feasibility for deployment.
