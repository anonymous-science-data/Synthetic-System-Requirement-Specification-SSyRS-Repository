Sessions expire after 90 minutes of inactivity.
Sensitivity of Actions & Permission Levels:

High Sensitivity: Budget modifications, project deletion, and final approval of content (Admins, Project Managers).
Moderate Sensitivity: Uploading and tagging assets (VFX teams, Post-Production Supervisors).
Low Sensitivity: Viewing project timelines and leaving comments (Creative Teams, External Reviewers).
3. Non-Functional Requirements
Performance:

Tasks such as opening projects or uploading assets must respond within 3 seconds.
System should support simultaneous task assignments for up to 500 users without noticeable delays.
Scalability:

Designed to handle seasonal peaks, such as during post-production crunch periods for high-budget productions.
Reliability:

99.8% uptime SLA with automated backups every 4 hours.
Quick recovery time of under 30 minutes in case of system failure.
Security:

End-to-end encryption for all project files and communication.
Strict role-based access control to ensure data is only accessible to authorized users.
Real-time threat detection and mitigation mechanisms.
Usability:

Intuitive drag-and-drop interfaces for task management.
Accessible on mobile devices to support on-the-go project tracking.
Support for colorblind accessibility and adjustable text sizes.
Audit & Monitoring:

Detailed logs of user actions, particularly for sensitive operations like budget adjustments.
Alerts for unusual activities, such as unauthorized access attempts.
4. Constraints
Technical Constraints:

Integration with existing editing and rendering tools, such as Adobe Premiere Pro and DaVinci Resolve.
Must support high-resolution asset uploads up to 500 GB per file.
Compliance Requirements:

Adherence to regional data protection laws, such as GDPR for EU users.
Compliance with industry standards like TPN (Trusted Partner Network) for secure content handling.
Resource Constraints:

Budget of $4 million for development and initial deployment.
Timeline of 9 months for delivery of a fully functional MVP.
Integration Needs:

Seamless API integration with third-party financial systems and existing content libraries.
Compatibility with single sign-on (SSO) solutions already in use by the organization.
This scenario provides a realistic and coherent solution tailored to the challenges of the Media and Entertainment industry, ensuring alignment with industry-specific workflows, technical requirements, and compliance standards.
