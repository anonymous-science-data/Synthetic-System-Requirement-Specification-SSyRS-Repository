Media and Entertainment Software System: Scenario
1. System Overview
System Purpose:
To develop a cloud-based collaborative video editing platform aimed at professional video production teams. The system will streamline the post-production process by enabling real-time collaboration, centralized asset management, and advanced editing tools. It must also integrate seamlessly with existing media asset management (MAM) systems used by major studios.

Domain/Context:
The system operates within the Media and Entertainment industry, focusing on post-production workflows for film, TV, and digital media. It addresses challenges such as remote collaboration, high-definition content handling, and tight production deadlines.

Stakeholders:

Production Teams: Video editors, sound engineers, colorists, and producers.
Studio Executives: Oversee project progress and approve deliverables.
IT Teams: Manage system deployment, integration, and maintenance.
Vendors: Third-party tool providers for special effects, color grading, or sound mixing.
User Base Characteristics:

Size: 2,000 to 10,000 active users across multiple production teams.
Diversity: Users include creative professionals with varying technical expertise and studio executives focused on oversight.
Geographic Distribution: Users are distributed globally, collaborating across time zones.
Roles: Editors, reviewers, administrators, and system integrators.
Operational Environment:

Hosted on a cloud-based infrastructure with global CDNs to ensure low-latency access.
Accessible via desktop applications (for editing) and web interfaces (for management and review).
Mobile app for producers and executives to approve cuts and provide feedback on the go.
Usage Scenarios:

Editing Workflow: Multiple editors work simultaneously on a single project timeline.
Review and Approval: Producers review rough cuts and provide feedback directly on the platform.
Asset Management: Teams upload, organize, and retrieve video and audio assets from a centralized library.
Export and Delivery: Finalized projects are exported in various formats for distribution.
2. Functional Requirements
Core Features:

Multi-user real-time editing with conflict resolution mechanisms.
Integrated comment and feedback tools on specific timeline sections.
Centralized media asset management with metadata tagging and search.
Support for importing/exporting projects in industry-standard formats (e.g., AAF, XML).
Integration with cloud storage and external MAM systems.
Authentication Conditions & Frequency:

Users authenticate at the start of each session.
Re-authentication required after 12 hours of inactivity or when performing sensitive actions such as:
Modifying project permissions.
Exporting projects to external systems.
Accessing system administration settings.
Sensitivity of Actions & Permission Levels:

High Sensitivity (Admin-only): System configurations, permission management, and integrations.
Medium Sensitivity (Editor and Producer): Asset uploads, timeline modifications, and project exports.
Low Sensitivity (Reviewer): Commenting, reviewing cuts, and viewing progress.
3. Non-Functional Requirements
Performance:

System response times under 200ms for standard interactions.
Able to support up to 1,000 concurrent active users per project timeline without performance degradation.
Scalability:

Automatic scaling to accommodate up to 50,000 active users and 10 petabytes of media data.
Support for 4K and 8K video editing and playback.
Reliability:

99.9% uptime SLA.
Failover mechanisms for cloud regions to ensure uninterrupted access during outages.
Security:

End-to-end encryption for all data transfers.
Role-based access control with granular permissions.
Usability:

Intuitive interface for non-technical users.
Customizable keyboard shortcuts for power users.
Tutorials and contextual help for onboarding.
Audit & Monitoring:

Detailed logging of all user actions, including asset uploads, timeline changes, and project exports.
Alerts for unusual activity, such as bulk deletion of assets or unauthorized access attempts.
4. Constraints
Technical Constraints:

Must operate seamlessly on both macOS and Windows for desktop users.
Support only Chromium-based browsers for web access.
Limited to integration with select MAM providers such as Avid or Blackmagic.
Compliance Requirements:

Adherence to GDPR for data protection.
Compliance with MPAA security guidelines for studios.
Resource Constraints:

Budget allocation: $10 million for development, testing, and deployment.
Dedicated team: 50 personnel, including developers, designers, and QA engineers.
Deployment timeline: 18 months.
Integration Needs:

Must integrate with existing cloud storage solutions such as AWS S3 and Google Cloud Storage.
APIs to sync metadata with external project management tools like ShotGrid.
