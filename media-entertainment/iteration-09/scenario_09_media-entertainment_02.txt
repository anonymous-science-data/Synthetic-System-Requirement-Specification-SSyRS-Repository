Media and Entertainment Software System: Scenario
1. System Overview
System Purpose:
To develop an AI-driven content tagging and distribution platform that automates metadata generation, enabling faster and more accurate categorization and syndication of media assets. This system targets media production houses and broadcasters aiming to improve content discoverability and streamline distribution to multiple channels.

Domain/Context:
The system operates in the Media and Entertainment sector, addressing the challenges of managing large volumes of video content, ensuring accurate metadata, and optimizing content delivery pipelines.

Stakeholders:

Broadcasters: Use the platform to tag and distribute content to streaming platforms and traditional TV networks.
Production Houses: Generate detailed metadata to improve content searchability and archiving.
Marketing Teams: Leverage the metadata for targeted content promotion.
IT Teams: Ensure the system integrates with existing asset management systems and adheres to technical requirements.
User Base Characteristics:

Size: Approximately 5,000 users initially, with plans to scale to 15,000 users globally.
Diversity: Users range from content archivists and marketing teams to IT administrators and media analysts.
Geographic Distribution: Predominantly North America, Europe, and Asia-Pacific, with additional users in emerging markets.
Roles: Metadata specialists, marketing professionals, system administrators, and content distributors.
Operational Environment:

Cloud-based system with regional data centers to ensure low-latency access for users worldwide.
Web-based interface for metadata tagging and review, supported by APIs for automated ingestion and export.
Mobile app for content distributors to monitor syndication statuses and resolve issues on the go.
Usage Scenarios:

Metadata Generation: AI generates preliminary metadata based on video analysis, which users refine and approve.
Content Syndication: Users schedule and distribute content to platforms like Netflix, Hulu, and YouTube with platform-specific metadata requirements.
Search and Discovery: Archivists search for assets using AI-enhanced metadata to find relevant content for reuse.
2. Functional Requirements
Core Features:

AI-driven metadata generation based on video, audio, and subtitle analysis.
Platform-specific metadata templates for content syndication.
Integration with major MAM systems and content delivery networks (CDNs).
User-friendly interfaces for manual metadata editing and approval workflows.
Notifications for syndication errors or missing metadata.
Authentication Conditions & Frequency:

Users authenticate once per session, with sessions expiring after 8 hours of inactivity.
Re-authentication required for accessing audit logs, managing system integrations, and performing bulk deletions.
Sensitivity of Actions & Permission Levels:

High Sensitivity (Admins): Managing platform integrations, configuring AI models, and auditing activity logs.
Medium Sensitivity (Content Managers): Approving metadata, scheduling content for distribution, and managing user roles within teams.
Low Sensitivity (Marketing Teams): Viewing metadata, generating reports, and monitoring distribution statuses.
3. Non-Functional Requirements
Performance:

Metadata generation should not exceed 60 seconds per hour of video content analyzed.
Content syndication requests processed in under 5 seconds for high-priority platforms.
Scalability:

Capable of handling a library of 50 million assets and supporting 100 concurrent syndication requests.
Supports the addition of new platforms without significant reconfiguration.
Reliability:

99.95% uptime SLA, with automated failover between data centers.
Redundant processing pipelines for AI metadata generation to avoid single points of failure.
Security:

Encrypted storage for all media assets and metadata.
Role-based access controls and activity monitoring to prevent unauthorized changes.
Usability:

Accessible design ensuring compliance with WCAG 2.1 guidelines.
Onboarding tutorials and contextual help for metadata specialists and first-time users.
Audit & Monitoring:

Comprehensive logging of metadata changes, syndication requests, and system configurations.
Real-time alerts for anomalous behavior, such as large-scale deletion of metadata or repeated syndication failures.
4. Constraints
Technical Constraints:

System optimized for integration with AWS-based MAM systems and requires API compatibility with major CDNs.
Limited to English, French, Spanish, and Mandarin for metadata generation at launch.
Compliance Requirements:

GDPR compliance for users in the EU.
Adherence to SMPTE metadata standards for broadcasters.
Resource Constraints:

Budget allocation: $15 million over 24 months.
Project team: 70 members, including data scientists, software engineers, and UX designers.
Integration Needs:

Seamless integration with existing MAM solutions such as Avid and Adobe.
APIs for third-party systems to retrieve metadata and syndication statuses.
This scenario outlines a robust, realistic system addressing critical challenges in the Media and Entertainment industry. Let me know if further refinements are needed!
