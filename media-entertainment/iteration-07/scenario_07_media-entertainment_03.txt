Directors and Producers: Oversee creative alignment and approve drafts.
Storyboard Artists: Create and share visual sequences for scripts.
Legal Teams: Ensure intellectual property compliance.
IT Administrators: Maintain system security and performance.
User Base Characteristics:

Initial user base of 2,000 professionals, scaling to 7,000 within three years.
Users span scriptwriters, directors, storyboard artists, and production coordinators, distributed globally across studios and independent teams.
Operational Environment:
A cloud-based system accessible through a responsive web application, with native mobile and tablet support to facilitate on-the-go collaboration. The platform integrates with popular design tools like Adobe Photoshop and cloud storage providers.

Usage Scenarios:

Scriptwriters collaborating in real time on scene dialogue and structure.
Directors providing comments and requesting changes to storyboards.
Producers approving finalized scripts and visual sequences.
Storyboard artists importing sketches from external tools and aligning them with the script.
IT administrators setting user permissions and monitoring activity logs.
2. Functional Requirements
Core Features:

Storyboarding tools with support for importing, arranging, and annotating images.
Version control for scripts and storyboards, allowing rollback to previous drafts.
Workflow automation for review and approval processes.
Notifications for task completions, comments, and approvals.
Authentication Conditions & Frequency:

Authentication required at session start; sessions expire after 12 hours of inactivity.
Re-authentication required for critical actions, such as approving final drafts or modifying permissions.
Sensitivity of Actions & Permission Levels:

High Sensitivity: Finalizing scripts or storyboards, altering project permissions-restricted to producers and directors.
Medium Sensitivity: Editing scripts, uploading storyboards-assigned to scriptwriters and storyboard artists.
Low Sensitivity: Viewing drafts and commenting-accessible to all project members.
3. Non-Functional Requirements
Performance:

Real-time editing latency <=1 second with up to 50 simultaneous collaborators.
Average response time <=3 seconds for loading storyboards or scripts.
Scalability:

Must support a 250% increase in concurrent users and a 400% increase in stored projects over five years.
Reliability:

99.9% uptime SLA with automatic failover and recovery mechanisms in case of critical failures.
Security:

End-to-end encryption for all data transfers.
Role-based access control and periodic audits of permissions.
Usability:

Intuitive user interface with drag-and-drop functionality for storyboards.
Accessibility features, including text-to-speech and colorblind-friendly design.
Audit & Monitoring:

Comprehensive activity logging for editing, approvals, and user actions.
Alerts for unusual activity, such as unauthorized access attempts or simultaneous logins from different locations.
4. Constraints
Technical Constraints:

Hosted on multi-region AWS infrastructure with integrated content delivery networks (CDNs).
Requires seamless integration with Adobe Creative Cloud and Google Drive for media imports.
Compliance Requirements:

GDPR compliance for users in Europe.
Intellectual property protection and adherence to copyright regulations for scripts and visual assets.
Resource Constraints:

Budget of $3.5 million for development and initial deployment.
A team of 22 members, including developers, UX designers, QA engineers, and domain consultants.
18-month development timeline, including a 3-month beta testing phase.
Integration Needs:

APIs for integration with third-party design tools and cloud storage platforms.
Compatibility with existing Single Sign-On (SSO) systems for enterprise users.
This scenario presents a feasible and detailed plan for a real-time collaborative scriptwriting and storyboarding platform, tailored to meet the challenges of the media and entertainment industry. It reflects realistic resource allocation and aligns with industry practices.
