This repository contains all 300 generated SSyRS structured by Industry Domains.
Each Industry Domain is stored in an individual folder with sub-folders for each of the ten iterations.
Each iteration folder contains three generated SSyRS.

### Note

At the outset, the artefacts targeted for generation were referred to as ”evaluation scenarios,” rather than SSyRS. This naming reflected the preliminary understanding of the task, as well as the absence of a formalised artefact definition. As the process matured, it became clear that the desired outputs aligned closely with system requirement specifications, resulting in the shift in terminology to SSyRS. Despite this change in terminology, all ten iterations used the word “scenario” when instructing the model.
