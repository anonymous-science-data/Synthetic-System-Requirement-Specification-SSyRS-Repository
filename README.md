This repository contains all 300 generated SSyRS structured by Industry Domains.
Each Industry Domain is stored in an individual folder with sub-folders for each of the ten iterations.
Each iteration folder contains three generated SSyRS.

### Note

Note that we used the generic term “scenario” instead of “SSyRS”. to reduce possible hallucinations. Since GPT models are trained on internet data, we were concerned that incorrect or vague uses of the term “SyRS” could encourage hallucinations; a risk, that might be mitigated by using more generic instructions.
