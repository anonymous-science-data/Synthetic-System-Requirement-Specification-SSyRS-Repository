Scenario: National Emergency Services Coordination System (NESCS)

1. System Overview
System Purpose:
The National Emergency Services Coordination System (NESCS) aims to centralize the coordination and management of emergency services during natural disasters, public health crises, and other emergencies. The system facilitates resource allocation, real-time communication, and progress tracking across federal, state, and local agencies.

Domain/Context:
NESCS operates within the emergency management and public safety domain, ensuring that government resources are deployed efficiently and transparently in response to crises.

Stakeholders:

Government Agencies: Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), state emergency management departments, and municipal agencies.
Emergency Responders: Firefighters, law enforcement, and medical personnel.
Public Officials: Mayors, governors, and other decision-makers.
General Public: Citizens requiring real-time updates and assistance.
User Base Characteristics:
The system serves approximately 500,000 users, including emergency responders, government officials, and support staff. It must also provide public-facing functionality for millions of citizens during active emergencies.

Operational Environment:
The NESCS is a cloud-based platform accessible via desktop, tablet, and mobile devices. Field responders access the system through ruggedized mobile applications with offline capabilities.

Usage Scenarios:

A state official declares an emergency, triggering the system to allocate resources and notify federal agencies.
A firefighter submits a request for additional equipment using the mobile application.
Citizens receive real-time updates and evacuation orders through a public notification portal.
An administrator generates a report on resource utilization and response efficiency for federal review.
2. Functional Requirements
Core Features:

Incident Management Dashboard: Centralized view of active emergencies, resource allocations, and response timelines.
Resource Request System: Tools for submitting, approving, and tracking resource requests in real-time.
Public Notification Module: Automated dissemination of alerts and updates to citizens.
Collaboration Tools: Secure chat and video conferencing for agency coordination.
Reporting and Analytics: Customizable reporting on response metrics and outcomes.
Authentication Conditions & Frequency:

Users authenticate at the start of each session, with multifactor authentication required for accessing sensitive data or submitting critical requests.
Field responders authenticate once every 24 hours or when performing a sensitive action.
Sensitivity of Actions & Permission Levels:

Responders: Limited to submitting requests and updating incident statuses.
Regional Officials: Approve resource requests and oversee incident management.
Federal Administrators: Full system access, including configuration and audit logs.
3. Non-Functional Requirements
Performance:

Response time for key actions (e.g., submitting a resource request) must not exceed 3 seconds under normal conditions.
The system should handle up to 1,000 simultaneous active incidents and 20,000 concurrent users.
Scalability:

Must accommodate a 100% surge in user activity during major national emergencies.
Scalable architecture to integrate new modules for future disaster types.
Reliability:

99.95% uptime, with automated failover and replication across multiple geographic regions.
Recovery time objective (RTO) of 2 hours in the event of a major failure.
Security:

End-to-end encryption for all communications and data.
Role-based access control with strict adherence to federal cybersecurity standards.
Usability:

User-friendly interface designed for both experienced and non-technical users.
Accessibility compliance with Section 508 and WCAG 2.1 standards.
Audit & Monitoring:

Detailed logging of all actions, with automated alerts for anomalies or unauthorized access attempts.
Real-time monitoring dashboards for system administrators.
4. Constraints
Technical Constraints:

The system must comply with federal government standards for cloud hosting (FedRAMP).
Compatibility with legacy systems used by state and municipal agencies.
Compliance Requirements:

Must adhere to the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) guidelines.
Ensure compliance with the Stafford Act for disaster response funding and reporting.
Resource Constraints:

Development budget capped at $15 million over three years.
Limited IT personnel available for ongoing maintenance after deployment.
Integration Needs:

Seamless integration with the National Weather Service's alert systems and state-level emergency response platforms.
This scenario reflects a comprehensive and realistic system proposal for the Government and Public-Services sector, addressing specific challenges in emergency response coordination.
