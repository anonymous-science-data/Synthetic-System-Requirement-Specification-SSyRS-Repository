Scenario: Integrated Public Benefits Management System (PBMS)

1. System Overview
System Purpose:
The Integrated Public Benefits Management System (PBMS) is designed to streamline the application, review, and management of public assistance programs such as housing subsidies, unemployment benefits, and healthcare aid. Its primary objectives are to improve service delivery efficiency, enhance transparency, and ensure compliance with regulatory frameworks.

Domain/Context:
The PBMS operates within the Government and Public-Services domain, specifically targeting state and local agencies responsible for administering public benefit programs.

Stakeholders:

Government Agencies: Departments of Housing, Labor, and Health Services.
End Users: Applicants, case managers, and program administrators.
Legislative Bodies: Overseeing compliance with funding and policy mandates.
Non-Profit Organizations: Assisting vulnerable populations in navigating the system.
User Base Characteristics:
The user base includes a diverse group of individuals and professionals:

Applicants from various socio-economic backgrounds and geographic regions.
Case managers and administrators distributed across state and municipal offices.
Support personnel assisting users with accessibility challenges.
Total users are estimated at 2 million, with 200,000 active users daily.
Operational Environment:
The system is hosted in a secure, government-approved cloud environment, accessible via a web portal and a mobile application. Case managers also access the system through on-premise kiosks at regional offices.

Usage Scenarios:

An applicant submits a new application for unemployment benefits, uploading required documents.
A case manager reviews and approves the application after cross-checking eligibility criteria.
Administrators generate compliance and performance reports for legislative oversight.
Non-profit workers assist clients in filling out forms and uploading documents.
2. Functional Requirements
Core Features:

Application Submission Portal: For new and renewal applications.
Eligibility Verification Engine: Automated checks against eligibility databases.
Case Management Tools: Dashboards for tracking and managing applications.
Notifications: Alerts for application status changes or required actions.
Reporting and Analytics: Tools for generating compliance and operational reports.
Authentication Conditions & Frequency:

Users authenticate using a government-issued ID and a secure password, with multifactor authentication for sensitive operations.
Authentication is required at the start of every session and upon performing administrative tasks like modifying eligibility rules.
Sensitivity of Actions & Permission Levels:

Applicants: Can only view and edit their applications.
Case Managers: Can review and approve applications but cannot modify applicant details.
Administrators: Can configure system rules, access full reports, and audit logs.
3. Non-Functional Requirements
Performance:

Average response time must not exceed 2 seconds for user actions.
The system must process up to 10,000 applications per hour during peak periods.
Scalability:

Designed to handle a 50% annual growth in user registrations.
Must support integration with additional state benefit programs over time.
Reliability:

99.9% uptime, with automated failover mechanisms.
Daily data backups and a disaster recovery system enabling full restoration within 4 hours.
Security:

Encrypted data storage and transmission.
Role-based access control with real-time intrusion detection.
Usability:

Adherence to WCAG 2.1 accessibility standards.
Simple, multilingual interface supporting English, Spanish, and three additional languages.
Audit & Monitoring:

Comprehensive logging of all user actions, particularly approvals and changes to application data.
Alerts for unauthorized access attempts.
4. Constraints
Technical Constraints:

Must operate within the constraints of the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP) for cloud systems.
Compatibility with existing state-level identity verification services.
Compliance Requirements:

Must comply with HIPAA for handling healthcare-related data.
Adherence to federal and state data retention and privacy laws.
Resource Constraints:

Development budget capped at $10 million over two years.
Limited availability of technical personnel for system maintenance post-launch.
Integration Needs:

Seamless integration with existing unemployment databases, Medicaid eligibility systems, and financial reporting tools.
This scenario provides a comprehensive example of the challenges and requirements involved in creating a government-managed public services system.
