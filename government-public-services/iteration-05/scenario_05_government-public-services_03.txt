Scenario: Citizen Services Digital Access Platform (CSDAP)

1. System Overview
System Purpose:
The Citizen Services Digital Access Platform (CSDAP) is designed to provide a unified, user-friendly portal for accessing government services such as tax filing, driver's license renewals, voter registration, and public records requests. The platform aims to enhance citizen engagement, reduce administrative overhead, and improve service delivery efficiency.

Domain/Context:
The CSDAP operates within the Government and Public-Services domain, focusing on citizen-facing services managed by state and municipal governments.

Stakeholders:

Government Agencies: Departments of Transportation, Revenue, and Public Records.
Citizens: Users accessing various government services.
Administrators: Agency staff managing service workflows and system configurations.
Third-Party Vendors: Companies providing payment gateways, identity verification, and technical support.
User Base Characteristics:
The platform serves approximately 10 million citizens, with 500,000 monthly active users. The user base includes individuals of varying digital literacy levels, geographically dispersed across urban and rural areas. Administrative users total 5,000, distributed across different government agencies.

Operational Environment:
The system is hosted in a secure, government-approved cloud environment, accessible via web browsers and mobile applications. A desktop interface is optimized for administrators, while the citizen interface supports mobile-first design principles.

Usage Scenarios:

A citizen renews their driver's license by submitting an online application, uploading a scanned document, and paying the fee.
An administrator reviews flagged tax filings for potential errors or inconsistencies.
Citizens receive automated reminders for upcoming deadlines, such as tax payments or voter registration.
Agency staff generate reports on system usage and citizen satisfaction metrics.
2. Functional Requirements
Core Features:

Citizen Dashboard: Centralized access to all linked government services.
Online Application Submission: Tools for completing and submitting forms for various services.
Payment Integration: Secure payment options for services requiring fees.
Service Status Tracker: Real-time updates on application progress.
Notifications & Reminders: Alerts via email and SMS for important updates and deadlines.
Authentication Conditions & Frequency:

Citizens authenticate using a secure login with multifactor authentication (MFA) during account setup and sensitive actions (e.g., payment or personal data updates).
Administrators authenticate at the start of each session and re-authenticate every 12 hours for sensitive tasks.
Sensitivity of Actions & Permission Levels:

Citizens: Can access personal accounts, submit applications, and make payments but cannot alter government-configured workflows.
Administrators: Can manage workflows, access flagged cases, and configure notifications.
Super-Administrators: Have full system access, including audit logs and configuration settings.
3. Non-Functional Requirements
Performance:

The system must handle up to 100,000 concurrent users with a response time of under 3 seconds for common actions (e.g., form submission, status checks).
Scalability:

Must support a 50% increase in user registrations and activity during election cycles or tax filing periods.
Reliability:

Achieve 99.9% uptime with failover mechanisms and regional data redundancy.
Recovery point objective (RPO) of 6 hours and recovery time objective (RTO) of 12 hours in case of a major outage.
Security:

Employ end-to-end encryption, regular security audits, and role-based access control.
Adherence to NIST standards for public sector cybersecurity.
Usability:

The citizen interface must support English, Spanish, and two additional languages.
Compliance with WCAG 2.1 accessibility standards for users with disabilities.
Audit & Monitoring:

Log all user actions, particularly administrative updates and payment transactions.
Provide automated alerts for unusual activity patterns, such as failed login attempts or bulk data access.
4. Constraints
Technical Constraints:

The system must integrate with existing state-level databases and authentication systems, including those for tax records and voter registration.
Compliance Requirements:

Must adhere to state and federal data privacy laws, including GDPR-equivalent standards where applicable.
Ensure compliance with PCI-DSS for processing online payments.
Resource Constraints:

Initial development budget is capped at $20 million, with ongoing annual maintenance costs not exceeding $5 million.
The project must be completed within 24 months, with phased rollouts to prioritize high-demand services.
Integration Needs:

Integration with third-party payment processors, document verification APIs, and notification systems (email/SMS).
This scenario outlines a realistic system tailored to meet the needs of government agencies and citizens, addressing challenges related to scalability, accessibility, and secure service delivery.
