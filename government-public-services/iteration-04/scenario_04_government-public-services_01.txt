Scenario: Digital Permitting and Licensing System (DPLS)
1. System Overview
System Purpose:
The Digital Permitting and Licensing System (DPLS) is designed to streamline the application, review, issuance, and renewal of permits and licenses for businesses and individuals. Its primary goal is to reduce processing time, improve transparency, and ensure compliance with regulatory standards.

Domain/Context:
The system operates in the municipal government domain, focusing on public service delivery for business operations, construction permits, and professional licenses.

Stakeholders:
Key stakeholders include municipal administrators, business owners, contractors, regulatory agencies, and public auditors.

User Base Characteristics:
The user base comprises approximately 15,000 users, including diverse roles such as small business owners, contractors, government clerks, and regulatory inspectors. Users are distributed across multiple districts within a metropolitan region, with occasional access by state-level regulatory bodies.

2. Functional Requirements
Core Features:

Online application submission for various permits and licenses.
Automated document validation and fee calculation.
Real-time status tracking for applications.
Integration of a centralized dashboard for administrators to monitor applications and compliance.
Automated notifications and reminders for renewals or missing information.
Frequency of Authentication:
Users authenticate once per session using multi-factor authentication (MFA). Sessions expire after 30 minutes of inactivity.

Sensitivity of Actions:

High sensitivity: Approving or rejecting applications, modifying fee structures, and accessing personally identifiable information (PII).
Medium sensitivity: Viewing application statuses and submitting supporting documents.
3. Non-Functional Requirements
Performance:
The system should handle up to 500 concurrent users with a response time of under 2 seconds for most transactions.

Scalability:
The system must accommodate a 20% annual growth in users and data, supporting up to 30,000 users by year five without performance degradation.

Reliability:
The system requires 99.9% uptime, with automated failover capabilities and recovery mechanisms for critical failures.

Security:
All data transmissions must be encrypted using TLS 1.3. Role-based access control (RBAC) ensures users access only the data and actions relevant to their role. The system must comply with CJIS and NIST SP 800-53 standards.

Usability:
The interface must meet WCAG 2.1 Level AA accessibility standards, ensuring it is navigable by users with disabilities.

4. Constraints
Technical Constraints:

The system will be hosted on a government cloud platform certified for public sector use.
The system must support integration with the existing municipal payment gateway and identity management solution.
Compliance Requirements:

Adherence to state-level data privacy laws and federal regulations such as the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA).
Regular audits to ensure compliance with public procurement rules.
Resource Constraints:

The project budget is capped at $5 million, with a development timeline of 18 months.
A core team of eight developers and three business analysts is available for implementation.
Integration Needs:

The system must interface with GIS systems to validate zoning requirements and state databases for verifying professional credentials.
This scenario represents a realistic challenge in the Government and Public Services sector, highlighting both the opportunities and constraints of implementing digital solutions for public service efficiency.
