Scenario: Emergency Assistance Coordination Platform (EACP)
1. System Overview
System Purpose:
The Emergency Assistance Coordination Platform (EACP) is designed to streamline communication, resource allocation, and task management during disaster response efforts. The primary goal is to improve coordination between emergency responders, government agencies, and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) to enhance the efficiency of relief operations.

Domain/Context:
The system operates in the disaster management and public safety domain, supporting emergency response activities during natural disasters, public health crises, and large-scale incidents.

Stakeholders:
Key stakeholders include local and regional emergency management agencies, first responders, healthcare organizations, NGOs, and affected citizens relying on aid.

User Base Characteristics:
The user base consists of approximately 10,000 users, including emergency coordinators, field personnel, volunteers, and government administrators. Users are distributed across state and local jurisdictions, with diverse technical proficiencies and needs.

2. Functional Requirements
Core Features:

A central dashboard for incident reporting, resource tracking, and task assignment.
Real-time communication tools for responders, including chat and emergency alerts.
A geospatial mapping tool for visualizing disaster impact areas, resource locations, and responder positions.
Automated workflow management for task prioritization and progress tracking.
Citizen-facing portal for submitting assistance requests and receiving status updates.
Frequency of Authentication:
Field personnel and coordinators authenticate once per session using MFA. Sessions auto-expire after 60 minutes of inactivity. Administrators authenticate per action when performing high-sensitivity tasks.

Sensitivity of Actions:

High sensitivity: Approving resource deployments, accessing PII of affected citizens, and making system-wide configuration changes.
Medium sensitivity: Submitting incident reports and assigning tasks.
3. Non-Functional Requirements
Performance:
The system must handle up to 2,000 concurrent users with a response time of under 2.5 seconds for most actions.

Scalability:
The system must support a 100% increase in user activity during peak disaster periods, scaling up to 20,000 users with no degradation in performance.

Reliability:
The system requires 99.9% uptime, with failover mechanisms to ensure continuity during critical operations. Disaster recovery plans must guarantee data restoration within 1 hour of a major failure.

Security:
Role-based access control (RBAC) must limit sensitive data access. All data transmission must use end-to-end encryption (TLS 1.3), and data at rest must comply with FISMA standards. Regular penetration testing and vulnerability assessments are mandatory.

Usability:
The system must comply with WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards. A low-bandwidth mode is essential to ensure accessibility for users in disaster-affected areas with poor internet connectivity.

4. Constraints
Technical Constraints:

The system must operate on a cloud-first architecture but support offline functionality for field personnel in disconnected environments.
It must integrate with existing systems, such as FEMA's disaster management database and local 911 systems.
Compliance Requirements:

Adherence to the Stafford Act and FEMA regulations for disaster response systems.
Compliance with federal and state-level privacy laws governing the handling of sensitive citizen data.
Resource Constraints:

The project budget is capped at $4.5 million, with a 30-month implementation timeline.
Development resources include eight software engineers, three system architects, and five business analysts.
Integration Needs:

The system must integrate with geospatial data providers for mapping, third-party communication platforms (e.g., SMS gateways), and federal emergency response tools.
This scenario is realistic for the Government and Public Services sector, reflecting critical challenges and constraints in disaster management and emergency response systems.
