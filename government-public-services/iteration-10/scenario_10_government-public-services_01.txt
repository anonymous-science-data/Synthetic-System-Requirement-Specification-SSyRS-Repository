1. System Overview

System Purpose:
The system, called "Emergency Relief Resource Allocation System" (ERRAS), is designed to streamline the allocation and tracking of emergency relief resources (e.g., food supplies, medical equipment, and temporary shelters) during disaster response operations. Its main objective is to improve the speed, accuracy, and accountability of resource distribution in disaster-affected areas.

Domain/Context:
ERRAS operates within the Government and Public Services domain, specifically focusing on disaster management and emergency response services. It supports both national and regional government agencies, NGOs, and other emergency response stakeholders.

Stakeholders:

    Primary: Disaster response coordinators, logistics managers, and government officials managing relief efforts.
    Secondary: Field workers, local government units, partner NGOs, and auditing agencies.
    Tertiary: Affected citizens, who indirectly benefit from the improved efficiency of resource allocation.

User Base Characteristics:

    Size: Medium-scale user base (~5,000 concurrent users during peak operations).
    Diversity: Includes government employees, NGO representatives, field workers, and auditors, with varying technical expertise.
    Geographic Distribution: Distributed across multiple regions, including urban, rural, and remote disaster-affected areas.
    Roles: Users are categorized as administrators, planners, field coordinators, auditors, and general data input personnel.

Operational Environment:

    Hosted as a cloud-based platform with offline access capabilities for field operations.
    Accessible via desktop and mobile devices to ensure usability in remote and resource-constrained environments.

Usage Scenarios:

    Daily Use: Resource request and approval workflows, tracking inventory levels, and generating situation reports.
    Emergency Use: Rapid resource allocation for specific disaster zones, coordination of field operations, and prioritization of critical supplies.

2. Functional Requirements

Core Features:

    Resource Request and Approval: Submit and process requests for emergency supplies.
    Real-Time Resource Tracking: Monitor the status and location of supplies across all stages of distribution.
    Prioritization Engine: Automatically rank requests based on urgency, resource availability, and affected population size.
    Field Data Input: Allow field workers to update resource statuses offline, with automatic syncing when connectivity is restored.
    Reporting and Dashboards: Generate real-time and historical reports for decision-makers.
    Audit Logs: Maintain detailed logs of all transactions and decisions for accountability.

Authentication Conditions & Frequency:

    Session Expiration: Automatic logouts after 30 minutes of inactivity.
    Sensitive Actions: Reauthentication required for high-impact actions such as resource approval over a specific threshold or altering critical workflows.

Sensitivity of Actions & Permission Levels:

    High Sensitivity: Resource approvals, inventory adjustments, and system configurations (restricted to administrators and managers).
    Moderate Sensitivity: Data entry and field status updates (accessible to field workers and coordinators).
    Low Sensitivity: Report generation and dashboard viewing (accessible to all roles with appropriate permissions).

3. Non-Functional Requirements

Performance:

    Response time under 3 seconds for standard operations.
    Capable of processing 100,000 transactions per day during peak disaster scenarios.

Scalability:

    Must handle a 200% increase in user load and data volume during major disasters without degradation in performance.

Reliability:

    99.9% uptime SLA, with failover capabilities to a secondary data center.
    Automatic data backups every 30 minutes to ensure disaster recovery.

Security:

    Enforce strict access control based on user roles and geographic regions.
    End-to-end encryption for all data transmissions and storage.

Usability:

    Optimized for use on low-bandwidth connections.
    Adheres to WCAG 2.1 accessibility standards to support users with disabilities.

Audit & Monitoring:

    Comprehensive logging of user activities and system events, stored for a minimum of 7 years.
    Automated alerts for anomalous activities, such as unusually high resource approvals.

4. Constraints

Technical Constraints:

    Operates on a government-mandated cloud platform with predefined infrastructure standards.
    Limited support for integrating proprietary hardware in remote areas.

Compliance Requirements:

    Adherence to the countryâ€™s Disaster Management Act, which outlines specific data retention and audit requirements.
    Compliance with international standards for humanitarian aid coordination (e.g., Sphere Standards).

Resource Constraints:

    Initial development budget capped at $3 million with a 24-month implementation timeline.
    Development team limited to 20 personnel, including engineers, analysts, and project managers.

Integration Needs:

    Integration with existing government GIS systems for disaster mapping.
    Seamless data exchange with external logistics platforms used by partner NGOs.

This scenario represents a realistic, domain-specific solution tailored to the challenges faced by emergency management services, incorporating diverse user needs, operational environments, and strict compliance requirements.
