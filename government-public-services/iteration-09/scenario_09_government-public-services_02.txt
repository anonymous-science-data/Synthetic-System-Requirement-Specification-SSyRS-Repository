Scenario: Public Infrastructure Inspection and Maintenance System (PIIMS)
1. System Overview
System Purpose:
The Public Infrastructure Inspection and Maintenance System (PIIMS) is designed to digitize and streamline the management of inspections and maintenance of public infrastructure, such as roads, bridges, and government buildings. The system facilitates real-time reporting, scheduling, and tracking of inspections and repairs to improve efficiency and ensure safety compliance.

Domain/Context:
Government and Public Services, specifically infrastructure management and maintenance.

Stakeholders:

Inspection Teams: Field inspectors responsible for assessing the condition of infrastructure.
Maintenance Crews: Teams tasked with performing repairs and upkeep based on inspection findings.
Public Works Administrators: Oversee infrastructure projects, manage budgets, and ensure compliance with safety standards.
Government Officials: Use data to allocate resources and prioritize funding for critical projects.
IT and Security Teams: Support and maintain the system's operational integrity and data security.
User Base Characteristics:

Size: Approximately 50,000 active users annually, including field inspectors, maintenance personnel, and administrators.
Diversity: Users range from field workers in rural areas to administrators in urban offices, with varying levels of technical expertise.
Geographic Distribution: Nationwide system, accessible across all regions, including remote and rural areas.
Roles: Field inspectors, maintenance crews, administrators, and IT personnel.
Operational Environment:
The system is cloud-hosted, accessible via a web application for administrators and a mobile application for field inspectors and maintenance crews. The mobile app supports offline functionality for use in areas with limited connectivity.

Usage Scenarios:

Inspectors log observations and upload images of damaged infrastructure directly from the field.
Administrators schedule maintenance tasks based on inspection reports and prioritize repairs.
Maintenance crews receive task assignments, update the status of repairs, and upload completion reports.
Administrators and officials generate reports on infrastructure conditions and budget allocations.
2. Functional Requirements
Core Features:

Inspection Reporting: Field inspectors can log issues, upload images, and add location data.
Task Management: Assign and track maintenance tasks, including deadlines and resource allocations.
Real-Time Notifications: Notify stakeholders of urgent issues or task status changes.
Data Visualization: Interactive dashboards displaying infrastructure conditions, maintenance status, and resource usage.
Offline Capability: Mobile app functionality for reporting and updates in areas without internet access.
Authentication Conditions & Frequency:

Users authenticate at the start of each session.
Re-authentication is required for high-sensitivity actions, such as closing high-priority maintenance tasks or approving budget allocations.
Sessions expire after 1 hour of inactivity.
Sensitivity of Actions & Permission Levels:

High Sensitivity: Approving budgets, closing high-priority tasks, and modifying inspection standards (restricted to administrators).
Moderate Sensitivity: Submitting inspection reports and assigning tasks (field inspectors and administrators).
Low Sensitivity: Viewing task details and general reports (maintenance crews).
3. Non-Functional Requirements
Performance:

The system must handle up to 5,000 concurrent users with response times under 3 seconds for common actions.
Scalability:

Designed to accommodate a 20% annual increase in users and data volume.
Reliability:

99.9% uptime with failover mechanisms to ensure availability during emergencies.
Automated backups performed daily, with a recovery time objective (RTO) of 4 hours.
Security:

Data encryption at rest and in transit.
Role-based access control to limit access to sensitive features and data.
Regular security assessments and vulnerability testing.
Usability:

Mobile application optimized for ease of use with minimal training, suitable for field inspectors.
Compliance with WCAG 2.1 AA standards for accessibility.
Audit & Monitoring:

Comprehensive logging of all user actions, including authentication events and sensitive task completions.
Logs retained for 7 years to meet regulatory requirements.
4. Constraints
Technical Constraints:

Integration with existing geographic information systems (GIS) for accurate location tracking.
Mobile application must function on both Android and iOS devices, including older versions.
Compliance Requirements:

Adherence to OSHA and FHWA safety regulations for infrastructure projects.
Compliance with state and federal data protection laws.
Resource Constraints:

Project budget of $15 million over two years.
Development team of 40 staff, including engineers, testers, and project managers.
Integration Needs:

Seamless integration with public works asset management systems and state-level infrastructure databases.
This scenario represents a distinct and realistic government software project for managing public infrastructure, reflecting practical constraints, functional and non-functional requirements, and stakeholder needs.
