Scenario: Emergency Resource Allocation and Coordination System (ERACS)
1. System Overview
System Purpose:
The Emergency Resource Allocation and Coordination System (ERACS) is designed to enhance the ability of government agencies to coordinate and allocate resources effectively during emergencies such as natural disasters, public health crises, and infrastructure failures. The system ensures real-time visibility of resource availability, tracks deployment, and facilitates interagency collaboration.

Domain/Context:
Government and Public Services, specifically disaster management and emergency response coordination.

Stakeholders:

Emergency Response Teams: First responders and field personnel managing crises on-site.
Resource Managers: Individuals responsible for tracking and allocating resources such as medical supplies, vehicles, and personnel.
Government Officials: Decision-makers overseeing the response strategy and policy compliance.
Logistics Providers: Contractors or third-party vendors responsible for transportation and supply chain management.
IT Support Teams: Maintain system integrity, uptime, and performance.
User Base Characteristics:

Size: Approximately 75,000 active users, including emergency responders, resource managers, and administrators.
Diversity: A mix of government employees, contractors, and vendors across urban and rural areas.
Geographic Distribution: Nationwide coverage, including cross-agency and inter-state collaboration.
Roles: Field responders, resource managers, administrators, and policy decision-makers.
Operational Environment:
Cloud-hosted system with mobile and desktop access. The system must be operational in low-connectivity areas through offline capabilities, syncing data once connectivity is restored.

Usage Scenarios:

Resource managers log available inventory (e.g., medical kits, water supplies, vehicles).
Emergency responders request specific resources via the mobile app for immediate deployment.
Administrators monitor resource usage and generate real-time reports for decision-makers.
Logistics providers update delivery statuses and communicate delays or issues.
2. Functional Requirements
Core Features:

Inventory Management: Real-time tracking of available resources, including categorization and location data.
Request and Allocation Module: Streamlined process for submitting, approving, and fulfilling resource requests.
Collaboration Tools: Interagency messaging and notification system for coordinated responses.
Real-Time Reporting: Dashboards for monitoring resource distribution, gaps, and availability trends.
Offline Functionality: Ability for field responders to log requests and updates without active connectivity.
Authentication Conditions & Frequency:

Users authenticate at the beginning of their shift or session.
Re-authentication required when approving or reallocating critical resources or generating policy-level reports.
Sessions expire after 1 hour of inactivity, with notifications to save work before expiration.
Sensitivity of Actions & Permission Levels:

High Sensitivity: Approving resource allocation requests, modifying inventory data, and generating critical reports (restricted to resource managers and administrators).
Moderate Sensitivity: Submitting resource requests and logging field updates (field responders).
Low Sensitivity: Viewing general resource availability and system status (logistics providers).
3. Non-Functional Requirements
Performance:

The system must process resource requests within 2 seconds on average and handle 10,000 concurrent users during peak emergencies.
Scalability:

Capable of scaling to support surges in users and data during large-scale disasters, with a 30% capacity buffer for peak usage.
Reliability:

99.9% uptime, with automated failover and a recovery time objective (RTO) of 2 hours.
Security:

Role-based access control and encryption of all sensitive data in transit and at rest.
Regular vulnerability assessments and security audits to ensure compliance.
Usability:

Mobile and desktop interfaces designed for intuitive use with minimal training.
Compliance with WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility standards.
Audit & Monitoring:

Detailed logging of all resource transactions, authentication events, and sensitive actions.
Logs retained for 5 years for regulatory compliance and post-incident analysis.
4. Constraints
Technical Constraints:

Must integrate with existing geographic information systems (GIS) and emergency communication platforms.
Designed to operate efficiently in low-bandwidth environments, with lightweight mobile applications.
Compliance Requirements:

Adherence to FEMA regulations and standards for emergency response coordination.
Compliance with state and federal data privacy laws.
Resource Constraints:

Development budget of $20 million over three years.
Core development team of 50 personnel, including developers, testers, project managers, and domain specialists.
Integration Needs:

Integration with national emergency notification systems and state-level resource tracking platforms.
This scenario represents a unique and realistic system tailored for emergency resource management in the Government and Public Services domain. It balances technical feasibility, operational needs, and regulatory compliance within the given constraints.
