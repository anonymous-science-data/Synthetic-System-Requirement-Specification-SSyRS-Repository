Scenario for the Sector: Government and Public Services
1. System Overview
System Purpose:
The system, called "Smart Governance Hub (SGH)," is designed to digitize and centralize government services, enabling citizens to access public resources efficiently while reducing administrative overhead. The goal is to foster transparency, accountability, and citizen engagement through technology-driven solutions.

Domain/Context:
The system operates in the domain of e-governance, focusing on streamlining public services such as document issuance, welfare benefits, and grievance redressal.

Stakeholders:

Citizens: Individuals accessing government services, such as tax payments, license applications, or social benefit schemes.
Government Officials: Personnel managing, approving, or processing citizen requests.
IT Administrators: Teams responsible for system maintenance, security, and upgrades.
Third-Party Service Providers: Vendors managing payment gateways, identity verification, and communication tools.
User Base Characteristics:

Size: Tens of millions of citizens, ranging from tech-savvy urban users to those in rural areas with limited internet access.
Diversity: Users span various demographics, including age groups, literacy levels, and languages.
Geographic Distribution: Nation-wide, covering metropolitan regions, small towns, and remote villages.
Roles: End-users (citizens), administrators (government staff), and technical operators (IT personnel).
2. Functional Requirements
Core Features:

Citizen Dashboard: A personalized portal for users to track service requests, payments, and notifications.
Identity Authentication: Integration with a national ID system for secure login and verification.
Service Application Management: Tools for citizens to apply for and track public services like welfare programs or permits.
Grievance Redressal: A module for submitting and tracking complaints or suggestions.
Payment Gateway Integration: Seamless processing of taxes, fees, and fines.
Frequency of Authentication:

Per Session: Authentication is mandatory at the start of each session for personalized services.
For High-Sensitivity Actions: Additional steps like OTP or biometric verification are required for sensitive operations like document issuance or updating personal details.
Sensitivity of Actions:

High Sensitivity: Financial transactions, personal information updates, and welfare disbursements.
Moderate Sensitivity: Application submissions and tracking.
3. Non-Functional Requirements
Performance:

Response Times: All requests must be processed within 2 seconds for standard queries and 5 seconds for complex transactions.
Throughput: The system should handle up to 20,000 concurrent users during peak hours.
Scalability:

The system must accommodate future growth, scaling to serve up to 200 million users as new services are added.
Reliability:

Uptime: 99.9% availability, supported by redundant servers and failover mechanisms.
Error Handling: Comprehensive logging and automated recovery for critical failures.
Security:

Data Protection: End-to-end encryption of sensitive data during transmission and storage.
Access Control: Role-based access for different types of users, with periodic audits.
Threat Mitigation: Regular penetration testing and integration of AI-based threat detection systems.
Usability:

Accessibility: Compliance with WCAG 2.1 to support users with disabilities.
Multi-Language Support: Interfaces in major regional languages for inclusivity.
4. Constraints
Technical Constraints:

Must function on low-cost hardware such as basic smartphones and public kiosks.
Compatibility with outdated infrastructure in rural areas.
Compliance Requirements:

Adherence to national data privacy laws, such as GDPR-equivalent local regulations.
Transparency mandates requiring audit trails for all transactions.
Resource Constraints:

Limited budget of $15 million for development and initial deployment.
Development timeline restricted to 24 months.
Scarcity of local IT talent, requiring upskilling or outsourcing.
Integration Needs:

Compatibility with existing databases like voter records, land registries, and tax systems.
Seamless operation with third-party tools like e-signatures and external payment providers.
This scenario encapsulates a realistic, technology-driven approach to improving public service delivery in a government context.
