1. System Overview
System Purpose:
The system is designed to create a centralized citizen feedback and service request platform for municipal governments, enabling residents to submit service requests (e.g., pothole repair, waste collection issues), provide feedback on municipal projects, and track request statuses. The system will streamline government response processes, improve transparency, and foster citizen engagement.

Domain/Context:
Government and Public Services, specifically municipal service management and citizen engagement.

Stakeholders:

Primary Stakeholders: Citizens, municipal service department staff, city managers.
Secondary Stakeholders: Elected officials, auditors, and community advocacy groups.
User Base Characteristics:

Size: Approximately 200,000 active users annually (citizens) and 1,500 municipal staff.
Diversity: Includes residents with varying levels of technical proficiency, socioeconomic backgrounds, and language preferences.
Geographic Distribution: Urban and suburban regions covered by a mid-sized city government.
Roles:
Citizens: Submit and track requests.
Municipal staff: Review and process requests.
City managers: Monitor response performance.
Auditors: Review historical data for compliance.
Operational Environment:

Hosting: Cloud-based infrastructure, meeting local data sovereignty laws.
Access: Accessible via web browser and a mobile app.
Availability: 24/7 availability with scheduled maintenance during non-peak hours.
Usage Scenarios:

A citizen reports a streetlight outage using the mobile app and uploads a photo for context.
A municipal employee assigns the request to a repair team and updates the status.
A city manager reviews service response metrics and generates a report for elected officials.
An auditor reviews historical service request logs for compliance with service-level agreements (SLAs).
2. Functional Requirements
Core Features:

A citizen-facing portal for submitting service requests and tracking updates.
GIS integration to enable location-based tagging of service requests.
Workflow management for municipal staff to assign, update, and resolve requests.
Automated notifications for request status changes.
Reporting and analytics dashboards for city managers.
Feedback collection forms for municipal projects and initiatives.
Authentication Conditions & Frequency:

Citizens authenticate once per session, with sessions expiring after 30 minutes of inactivity.
Municipal staff authenticate at login and re-authenticate for actions involving status changes or SLA modifications.
City managers authenticate at login, with session expiration after 1 hour of inactivity.
Sensitivity of Actions & Permission Levels:

High Sensitivity: Modifying SLAs or accessing citizen data (restricted to city managers and senior staff).
Medium Sensitivity: Assigning or resolving requests (restricted to municipal staff).
Low Sensitivity: Submitting or tracking requests (citizens only).
3. Non-Functional Requirements
Performance:

System should process 95% of requests within 2 seconds.
Must support up to 1,000 concurrent users during peak usage periods.
Scalability:

Ability to scale to 500,000 annual users without degrading performance.
Reliability:

99.9% uptime with disaster recovery processes ensuring system restoration within 4 hours.
Security:

End-to-end encryption for all data transfers.
Role-based access controls with activity logging.
Usability:

Intuitive interface designed for mobile-first interaction.
WCAG 2.1 AA compliance with multilingual support (English, Spanish, Vietnamese).
Audit & Monitoring:

Comprehensive logging of all actions related to request updates and citizen data access.
Alerts for unusual activity, such as bulk modifications or repeated failed logins.
4. Constraints
Technical Constraints:

System must integrate with existing GIS and service ticketing platforms.
Cloud provider must meet government-approved security certifications (e.g., FedRAMP).
Compliance Requirements:

Adherence to municipal data retention policies (minimum 5 years).
Compliance with state and federal privacy regulations, such as CCPA and GDPR.
Resource Constraints:

Budget: $7 million allocated for design, development, deployment, and initial support.
Team: 25 members, including developers, testers, GIS specialists, project managers, and UX designers.
Timeline: 20 months, with a 4-month buffer for unexpected delays.
Integration Needs:

APIs for integration with municipal service ticketing systems and GIS databases.
Integration with city communication tools for notifications and alerts.
This scenario provides a practical and detailed outline of a citizen feedback and service request platform tailored to the needs of a mid-sized municipal government, ensuring a realistic balance between functional requirements, resource constraints, and operational goals.
