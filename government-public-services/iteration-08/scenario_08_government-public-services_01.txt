1. System Overview
System Purpose:
The system aims to streamline and digitize the processing of public housing applications, ensuring equitable allocation of housing resources and compliance with local and federal regulations. It will provide applicants with a transparent, user-friendly portal for submitting and tracking applications while enabling administrators to efficiently manage workflows and decision-making processes.

Domain/Context:
Government and Public Services, specifically in housing and urban development.

Stakeholders:

Primary Stakeholders: Housing applicants, local housing authority administrators.
Secondary Stakeholders: Community organizations, policymakers, and oversight bodies.
User Base Characteristics:

Size: Anticipated 100,000+ applicants annually and approximately 1,000 administrators.
Diversity: Includes individuals of varying technical literacy, languages, and access levels.
Geographic Distribution: Users from both urban and rural areas within a mid-sized state or region.
Roles: Applicants (primary users), administrators (secondary users), and auditors (occasional users).
Operational Environment:

Hosting: Cloud-based solution with redundancy for high availability.
Access: Browser-based portal with mobile compatibility.
Availability: 24/7 access for applicants; scheduled maintenance windows for updates.
Usage Scenarios:

Applicants submit required documents, fill out eligibility questionnaires, and track application status.
Administrators review applications, verify documentation, and allocate housing units based on priorities.
Auditors review system logs and decision histories for compliance purposes.
2. Functional Requirements
Core Features:

Online application form with real-time data validation.
Document upload and secure storage.
Automated eligibility scoring based on user input.
Workflow management for administrators to approve, reject, or request additional information.
Notifications for application updates (via email and SMS).
Reporting tools for administrators to generate housing allocation statistics.
Authentication Conditions & Frequency:

Applicants authenticate once per session; sessions expire after 30 minutes of inactivity.
Administrators authenticate at login and must re-authenticate for actions involving approval/rejection or access to applicant financial data.
Auditors authenticate at login with session expiration after 1 hour.
Sensitivity of Actions & Permission Levels:

High Sensitivity: Viewing applicant financial details (administrators only).
Medium Sensitivity: Approving/rejecting applications (administrators only).
Low Sensitivity: Viewing application statuses (applicants, administrators).
3. Non-Functional Requirements
Performance:

Response times under 2 seconds for 95% of actions.
Capable of handling 500 concurrent users during peak application periods.
Scalability:

Scale to support up to 1 million users annually with minimal performance degradation.
Reliability:

99.9% uptime with automated failover capabilities.
Daily backups with retention for 1 year.
Security:

End-to-end encryption for data in transit and at rest.
Role-based access control with strict least-privilege principles.
Usability:

User-friendly interface with multi-language support (e.g., English, Spanish, and Mandarin).
WCAG 2.1 AA compliance for accessibility.
Audit & Monitoring:

Comprehensive logging of all authentication events and sensitive actions.
Automated alerts for unusual access patterns or data modifications.
4. Constraints
Technical Constraints:

Hosted on a government-approved cloud provider meeting FedRAMP standards.
Must integrate with the existing case management system and state-level identity verification service.
Compliance Requirements:

Must adhere to HUD regulations, including fair housing policies.
Data protection compliance with GDPR (for applicants outside the U.S.) and CCPA.
Resource Constraints:

Budget of $5 million for development, deployment, and initial maintenance.
Development team of 20 staff, including developers, analysts, testers, and project managers.
18-month development timeline, including a 3-month buffer for unexpected delays.
Integration Needs:

Connect with existing government systems for identity verification and housing unit availability.
This scenario realistically encapsulates the challenges and requirements for a public housing application system, aligning with government service constraints and goals.
