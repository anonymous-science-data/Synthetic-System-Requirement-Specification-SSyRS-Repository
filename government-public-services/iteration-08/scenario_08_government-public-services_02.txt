1. System Overview
System Purpose:
To develop a digital permit management system for public infrastructure projects, streamlining the application, review, and approval processes while ensuring transparency, regulatory compliance, and efficient project tracking. The system aims to reduce delays in infrastructure development caused by manual and fragmented processes.

Domain/Context:
Government and Public Services, specifically public works and infrastructure management.

Stakeholders:

Primary Stakeholders: Infrastructure contractors, municipal project managers, public works administrators.
Secondary Stakeholders: Regulatory agencies, elected officials, citizens monitoring public works progress.
User Base Characteristics:

Size: 15,000 registered contractors, 500 municipal and state-level administrators.
Diversity: Users include large contracting firms, independent contractors, and geographically dispersed government staff.
Geographic Distribution: Users span urban, suburban, and rural jurisdictions across a state.
Roles: Contractors (applicants), project managers (reviewers), and auditors (compliance enforcers).
Operational Environment:

Hosting: Cloud-based system with state-approved hosting for data sovereignty.
Access: Accessible via desktop and mobile devices for on-site and remote users.
Availability: 24/7 availability with downtime scheduled during off-peak hours for updates.
Usage Scenarios:

Contractors submit permit applications, upload required documentation, and track approval status.
Administrators review applications, request clarifications, and approve or reject permits.
Auditors access system logs to review compliance with permitting policies and regulations.
2. Functional Requirements
Core Features:

Digital permit application form with dynamic field validations.
Integration with GIS for location-based project tracking.
Role-based dashboards for contractors, administrators, and auditors.
Automated notifications for application updates and deadlines.
Reporting tools for permit statistics and trends.
Public project portal for citizens to view approved permits and project timelines.
Authentication Conditions & Frequency:

Contractors authenticate at login, with sessions expiring after 20 minutes of inactivity.
Administrators authenticate at login and re-authenticate for actions like approval/rejection.
Auditors authenticate at login, with sessions expiring after 1 hour.
Sensitivity of Actions & Permission Levels:

High Sensitivity: Modifying project scope or budget approvals (administrators only).
Medium Sensitivity: Reviewing and approving applications (administrators only).
Low Sensitivity: Viewing permit statuses and public project information (contractors, auditors, citizens).
3. Non-Functional Requirements
Performance:

Response times under 1.5 seconds for 95% of user actions.
Support for 200 concurrent users with seamless performance.
Scalability:

Scalability to handle up to 50,000 contractors and 1,500 administrators as the system expands.
Reliability:

99.9% uptime with built-in redundancy for critical components.
Daily data backups with a retention period of 2 years.
Security:

Encryption of data at rest and in transit.
Role-based access control and periodic review of access logs.
Usability:

User interface designed with a focus on contractors with low technical expertise.
WCAG 2.1 AA compliance for accessibility, with support for multilingual interfaces (e.g., English, Spanish).
Audit & Monitoring:

Logging of all authentication events and administrative actions.
Alerts for unusual patterns, such as excessive rejections or login attempts.
4. Constraints
Technical Constraints:

System must integrate with existing GIS and municipal ERP systems.
Cloud infrastructure must comply with state-level IT security requirements.
Compliance Requirements:

Adherence to state and federal regulations governing infrastructure permits.
Compliance with data protection laws such as CCPA and GDPR for contractor data.
Resource Constraints:

Budget: $8 million allocated for development, deployment, and initial support.
Team: 30 staff, including developers, analysts, testers, GIS specialists, and project managers.
Timeline: 24 months, with a 4-month buffer for unforeseen delays.
Integration Needs:

Must integrate with external contractor databases for identity verification.
APIs required for data sharing with municipal ERP systems and GIS platforms.
This scenario provides a detailed and realistic example of a public works permit management system tailored to government and public service needs. It aligns with practical challenges and goals in this domain.
