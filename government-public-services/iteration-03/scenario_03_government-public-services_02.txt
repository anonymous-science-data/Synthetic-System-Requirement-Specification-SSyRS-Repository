Scenario: Disaster Response Coordination Platform
1. System Overview
System Purpose:
To create a centralized system for coordinating disaster response efforts, enabling real-time communication, resource allocation, and incident reporting for natural and man-made disasters.

Domain/Context:
Government and Public Services - Emergency Management and Disaster Response.

Stakeholders:

Primary: Emergency management agencies, first responders, and local government authorities.
Secondary: NGOs, utility providers, healthcare organizations, and citizens affected by disasters.
User Base Characteristics:

Size: 500,000+ users, including emergency personnel and public users during disaster events.
Diversity: Includes government employees, field responders, volunteers, and citizens.
Geographic Distribution: Coverage spans multiple regions, with priority zones based on disaster risk areas.
Roles: Administrators, field agents, coordinators, and citizens (reporting incidents or seeking information).
2. Functional Requirements
Core Features:

Incident Reporting: Allow citizens and responders to log incidents with geotagged data and images.
Resource Tracking: Real-time inventory and allocation of resources such as medical supplies, vehicles, and personnel.
Communication Hub: Centralized messaging and notification system for inter-agency coordination.
Dynamic Mapping: Interactive maps displaying live updates of affected areas, resource locations, and evacuation routes.
Citizen Updates: Notifications and alerts about evacuation orders, safety zones, and disaster recovery centers.
Frequency of Authentication:

Citizens: Per session for accessing public updates or logging incidents.
Emergency personnel: Per session and for critical actions, such as resource allocation or updating response plans.
Sensitivity of Actions:

High Sensitivity: Approving inter-agency resource allocation, modifying disaster response plans.
Moderate Sensitivity: Logging incidents, viewing restricted geospatial data.
Low Sensitivity: Viewing general disaster updates and safety tips.
3. Non-Functional Requirements
Performance:

System must handle 10,000 incident reports per hour during peak events.
Response time for high-priority operations: <2 seconds.
Scalability:

Support rapid scaling during disaster events to accommodate spikes in citizen and responder activity.
Expandable to include additional regions or disaster types.
Reliability:

Uptime of 99.99%, with robust failover systems for critical operations.
Automatic backups every 5 minutes during disaster events.
Security:

Role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict sensitive actions.
Data encryption for all communications and storage.
Multi-factor authentication for responders and administrators.
Usability:

Mobile-first design for field responders and citizens accessing via smartphones.
Accessibility features for users with disabilities, such as screen readers and voice commands.
Simple user interface for non-technical users.
4. Constraints
Technical Constraints:

Must integrate with existing government geospatial systems and emergency alert networks.
Operate within bandwidth constraints of disaster-affected areas with limited connectivity.
Compliance Requirements:

Must comply with data privacy regulations such as GDPR for personal information collected.
Meet accessibility standards like WCAG for public-facing interfaces.
Resource Constraints:

Budget capped at $10 million for development and deployment.
Core system to be operational within 18 months, with additional features rolled out post-launch.
Integration Needs:

Seamless integration with national emergency management systems and local utility providers for real-time updates.
API support for third-party NGO applications and volunteer management platforms.
This scenario outlines the requirements for a Disaster Response Coordination Platform, tailored to the unique challenges of emergency management within the Government and Public Services sector.
