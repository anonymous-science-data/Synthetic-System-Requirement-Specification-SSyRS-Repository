Scenario: Citizen Services Portal for Urban Development
1. System Overview
System Purpose:
To provide a centralized platform for citizens to access, track, and interact with urban development and city planning services, including building permit applications, public feedback on zoning changes, and project updates.

Domain/Context:
Government and Public Services - Urban Development and City Planning.

Stakeholders:

Primary: City residents, urban developers, city planning officers, and local government authorities.
Secondary: Environmental agencies, legal entities, and contractors.
User Base Characteristics:

Size: 1 million+ citizens in a metropolitan area.
Diversity: Residents with varying levels of tech literacy, urban developers, government officials, and contractors.
Geographic Distribution: Primarily localized within city limits but accessible to external contractors and remote stakeholders.
Roles: Residents (citizen users), developers (private entities submitting permits), administrators (government officials managing applications), and auditors (oversight authorities).
2. Functional Requirements
Core Features:

Citizen Portal: User dashboard for permit status, feedback submission, and public notices.
Application Management: Online submission and tracking of building permits, zoning requests, and project proposals.
Feedback Mechanism: Public comments and feedback collection on proposed city planning changes.
Geospatial Mapping: Interactive map for viewing active and proposed projects.
Notification System: Alerts for application status changes, upcoming hearings, and policy updates.
Frequency of Authentication:

Residents: Per session for accessing sensitive or personalized information.
Developers and administrators: Per session and for specific actions like submitting applications or approving requests.
Sensitivity of Actions:

High Sensitivity: Submission of legal documents (e.g., permits), approval of zoning changes, financial transactions for fees.
Moderate Sensitivity: Feedback on public forums, viewing project maps.
Low Sensitivity: Browsing general city information and public notices.
3. Non-Functional Requirements
Performance:

Average page load time: <2 seconds.
Concurrent users: Support 50,000 simultaneous users during peak periods.
Scalability:

Handle 20% annual growth in user registrations and application volume.
Ability to expand geospatial data layers as the city develops.
Reliability:

System uptime: 99.9%.
Real-time data backup and failover capabilities.
Security:

Multi-factor authentication for sensitive actions.
Data encryption in transit and at rest.
Role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict administrative features.
Usability:

Mobile-friendly interface.
Support for multiple languages to accommodate non-native speakers.
Comprehensive help and tutorial section for users with varying tech proficiency.
4. Constraints
Technical Constraints:

Must operate on the city's existing cloud-based infrastructure.
Limited compatibility with legacy systems still in use for certain departments.
Compliance Requirements:

Adherence to local data privacy laws and regulations (e.g., CCPA, municipal data sharing policies).
Ensure accessibility compliance under ADA guidelines.
Resource Constraints:

Initial budget of $5 million with annual maintenance capped at $500,000.
Development timeline restricted to 12 months.
Integration Needs:

Seamless integration with existing municipal GIS (Geographic Information System) for geospatial features.
Synchronization with city's financial system for fee processing.
This scenario provides a structured view of the requirements and challenges for developing a Citizen Services Portal, tailored to urban development and city planning needs.
