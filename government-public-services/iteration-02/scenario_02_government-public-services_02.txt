Scenario: Emergency Resource Coordination System (ERCS)
1. System Overview
System Purpose:
The Emergency Resource Coordination System (ERCS) is designed to optimize the allocation and management of critical resources during natural disasters, public health emergencies, and other crises. Its primary goals are to ensure timely delivery of resources, enhance situational awareness, and facilitate inter-agency collaboration.

Domain/Context:
Emergency management and disaster response within the public sector.

Stakeholders:

Emergency Response Teams: First responders, medical personnel, and logistics teams.
Government Agencies: Local, regional, and national authorities responsible for disaster management.
Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs): Relief organizations participating in disaster response efforts.
Citizens: Recipients of emergency resources and information.
IT Teams: Developers and administrators of the system.
User Base Characteristics:

Size: Thousands of government and NGO personnel during a crisis, and millions of citizens indirectly benefiting from the system.
Diversity: Includes users with varying technical expertise and resource needs.
Geographic Distribution: Nationwide coverage with special focus on disaster-prone regions.
Roles: Administrators (government and NGO managers), field operators (first responders), and citizens (information recipients).
2. Functional Requirements
Core Features:

Real-time resource tracking (e.g., food, medical supplies, personnel).
Automated resource allocation based on disaster severity and geographic need.
GIS-based visualization of affected areas and resource distribution.
Secure communication channels for inter-agency coordination.
Public-facing portals for citizens to request assistance and receive updates.
Frequency of Authentication:

Per session for field operators accessing resource tracking tools.
Per action for administrators performing resource allocations or updating critical data.
Sensitivity of Actions:

High Sensitivity: Resource reallocation, access to GIS visualizations, modifying citizen data.
Medium Sensitivity: Viewing resource availability or dispatch logs.
Low Sensitivity: Submitting public requests for assistance.
3. Non-Functional Requirements
Performance:

Response time < 1 second for citizen requests and resource updates.
System throughput capable of supporting 100,000 simultaneous requests during peak crises.
Scalability:

Must handle surges in user activity during disasters without performance degradation.
Reliability:

99.99% uptime during disaster events.
Built-in redundancy and real-time failover capabilities to ensure continuity.
Security:

Data encryption for all communications.
Role-based access control for sensitive operations.
Regular security audits and penetration tests.
Usability:

Simplified interfaces for non-technical users (field operators and citizens).
Mobile-first design for field operatives and citizens in remote areas.
4. Constraints
Technical Constraints:

Must operate on government-approved cloud platforms with limited bandwidth in rural areas.
Compatibility with existing GIS tools and emergency alert systems.
Compliance Requirements:

Must adhere to regional data protection laws and international disaster response guidelines.
Accessibility compliance for citizens with disabilities (e.g., WCAG).
Resource Constraints:

Limited funding for initial deployment; relies on phased rollouts.
Staffing constraints for real-time technical support during emergencies.
Integration Needs:

Integration with weather forecasting systems and local disaster warning networks.
Interoperability with existing resource management systems used by NGOs and government agencies.
