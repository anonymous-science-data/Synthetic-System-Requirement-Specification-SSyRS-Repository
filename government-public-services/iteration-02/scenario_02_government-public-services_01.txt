Scenario: Citizen Feedback Management System (CFMS)
1. System Overview
System Purpose:
The Citizen Feedback Management System (CFMS) aims to streamline the process of collecting, analyzing, and acting on feedback from citizens regarding public services. Its primary goal is to improve transparency, accountability, and responsiveness in government services.

Domain/Context:
Public administration and governance, with a focus on urban and rural local government services.

Stakeholders:

Government Officials: Policy-makers, administrators, and department heads responsible for public services.
Citizens: General public providing feedback on government services.
Technical Teams: IT staff maintaining and upgrading the system.
Third-party Agencies: Independent bodies for audits and analysis of feedback trends.
User Base Characteristics:

Size: Millions of users in a medium-sized country.
Diversity: Includes citizens of varying literacy levels, languages, and access to technology.
Geographic Distribution: Spanning urban centers, rural areas, and remote regions.
Roles: End-users include feedback providers (citizens), reviewers (government officials), and auditors (third-party agencies).
2. Functional Requirements
Core Features:

Multilingual feedback submission through web and mobile platforms.
Automated classification and routing of feedback to appropriate departments.
Dashboards for government officials to monitor trends and resolve issues.
Real-time status updates for citizens on their feedback submissions.
Analytics for identifying recurring issues and prioritizing resolutions.
Frequency of Authentication:

Per session for citizens providing feedback.
Per action for high-sensitivity operations like data export by administrators.
Sensitivity of Actions:

High Sensitivity: Exporting feedback data, altering citizen-submitted feedback, accessing detailed analytics reports.
Medium Sensitivity: Viewing department-level feedback.
Low Sensitivity: Submitting feedback.
3. Non-Functional Requirements
Performance:

Feedback submission response time < 2 seconds.
System throughput of 10,000 concurrent users during peak periods.
Scalability:

Seamless support for doubling the user base and feedback volume without performance degradation.
Reliability:

99.9% system uptime.
Automatic failover and data recovery mechanisms for service continuity.
Security:

Data encryption during transmission and storage.
Multi-factor authentication for administrative roles.
Regular vulnerability assessments and penetration testing.
Usability:

Intuitive UI/UX accessible to users with varying literacy levels.
Compliance with accessibility standards for users with disabilities.
4. Constraints
Technical Constraints:

Deployment on government cloud infrastructure with specific bandwidth and storage limits.
Compatibility with legacy government IT systems.
Compliance Requirements:

Adherence to data protection laws like GDPR or equivalent.
Ensuring accessibility compliance per regional standards (e.g., WCAG).
Resource Constraints:

Limited budget for initial deployment and subsequent upgrades.
Short development timeline of 12 months.
Integration Needs:

Integration with existing citizen databases and authentication systems (e.g., Aadhaar in India or SSN in the US).
Compatibility with public service platforms for data sharing and updates.
