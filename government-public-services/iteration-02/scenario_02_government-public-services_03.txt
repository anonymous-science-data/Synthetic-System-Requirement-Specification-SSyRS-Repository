Scenario: Public Infrastructure Monitoring and Maintenance System (PIMMS)
1. System Overview
System Purpose:
The Public Infrastructure Monitoring and Maintenance System (PIMMS) is designed to streamline the identification, reporting, and resolution of infrastructure issues such as road damage, streetlight failures, and water pipeline leaks. Its primary objective is to improve service delivery and ensure the timely upkeep of public infrastructure.

Domain/Context:
Municipal and urban governance, focusing on infrastructure management and public works.

Stakeholders:

Municipal Authorities: Responsible for monitoring, prioritizing, and addressing infrastructure issues.
Citizens: Individuals reporting infrastructure problems and tracking their resolution.
Maintenance Contractors: Teams tasked with addressing reported issues.
IT and Analytics Teams: Supporting system maintenance and providing insights on recurring problems.
User Base Characteristics:

Size: Hundreds of municipal officials and contractors, with a citizen base in the millions.
Diversity: Citizens of varying ages, technical abilities, and geographic locations.
Geographic Distribution: System use spans urban and suburban areas.
Roles: Administrators (municipal staff), issue reporters (citizens), and issue resolvers (contractors).
2. Functional Requirements
Core Features:

User-friendly mobile and web applications for citizens to report issues with geotagging and photos.
Automated prioritization of reported issues based on severity and location.
Real-time tracking of issue resolution progress for citizens and authorities.
Dashboards for municipal staff to monitor infrastructure health and maintenance schedules.
Predictive analytics for identifying areas at risk of infrastructure failure.
Frequency of Authentication:

Per session for citizens reporting issues.
Per action for administrators updating issue statuses or assigning tasks.
Sensitivity of Actions:

High Sensitivity: Assigning contractors, updating issue statuses, exporting analytics reports.
Medium Sensitivity: Viewing detailed issue logs or municipal dashboards.
Low Sensitivity: Submitting infrastructure reports or tracking issue status.
3. Non-Functional Requirements
Performance:

Issue submission response time < 3 seconds.
System throughput of 50,000 concurrent user actions during peak reporting times.
Scalability:

Must handle doubling of both issue reports and active users during emergencies or peak periods.
Reliability:

99.95% system uptime.
Backup and recovery systems for critical data in case of outages.
Security:

Role-based access control for municipal staff and contractors.
Encryption of user data and uploaded photos.
Regular security audits and updates to address vulnerabilities.
Usability:

Intuitive interfaces for citizens of all technical abilities.
Multilingual support to accommodate diverse populations.
4. Constraints
Technical Constraints:

The system must operate on municipal IT infrastructure with limited server capacity.
Integration with existing municipal GIS systems for geotagging issues.
Compliance Requirements:

Adherence to regional data protection laws and open data policies for transparency.
Accessibility compliance for citizens with disabilities (e.g., WCAG).
Resource Constraints:

Limited initial deployment budget with plans for phased feature rollouts.
Reliance on part-time contractors for system maintenance.
Integration Needs:

Integration with municipal service request systems and contractor scheduling tools.
Compatibility with citizen identification systems for authentication.
