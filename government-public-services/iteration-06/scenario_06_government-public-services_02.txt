Scenario: Emergency Response Management System (ERMS) for Local Governments
1. System Overview
System Purpose:
The Emergency Response Management System (ERMS) aims to improve the coordination and management of emergency services during crises such as natural disasters, public health emergencies, and large-scale accidents. It centralizes communication, resource allocation, and incident reporting to reduce response times and enhance situational awareness.

Domain/Context:
The ERMS operates in the domain of public safety and emergency services, specifically supporting local governments in managing and responding to critical incidents efficiently.

Stakeholders:

Emergency Responders: Firefighters, police officers, and medical personnel who rely on the system for real-time updates and task assignments.
Incident Coordinators: Municipal emergency management staff responsible for resource allocation and strategic oversight.
Government Officials: City managers and elected officials who require data for decision-making and post-incident reporting.
IT Administrators: Maintain the system, ensuring security, availability, and performance.
User Base Characteristics:

Size: Approximately 2,000 active users during emergencies, with about 500 daily users in non-crisis scenarios.
Diversity: Users include field personnel, office-based staff, and senior officials, with varying levels of technical proficiency.
Geographic Distribution: Concentrated within a single city or county but capable of scaling to neighboring regions during large-scale incidents.
Roles: Field responders, coordinators, administrators, and government decision-makers.
Operational Environment:

Cloud-based platform accessible via secure web browsers and mobile apps optimized for field use.
Integrated with GIS systems for real-time mapping of incident locations and resource deployments.
Operable on low-bandwidth networks to support use in remote or disaster-affected areas.
Usage Scenarios:

Incident coordinators log and track emergency calls, assign resources, and monitor response progress.
Responders receive task assignments and update incident statuses via mobile devices.
Administrators configure system settings, manage user roles, and review system performance.
Decision-makers access dashboards for insights on response effectiveness and resource utilization.
2. Functional Requirements
Core Features:

Incident logging with fields for location, severity, type, and resource needs.
Real-time task assignment and updates, viewable on a GIS-enabled interface.
Communication module for field personnel and coordinators, including priority messaging.
Resource tracking for equipment, vehicles, and personnel availability.
Reporting tools for generating after-action reviews and compliance reports.
Authentication Conditions & Frequency:

Users authenticate at the beginning of each shift, with re-authentication required after 1 hour of inactivity.
Sensitive actions, such as assigning resources or escalating incident severity, require immediate re-authentication.
Mobile app users authenticate once per session, with biometrics or a PIN required for quick re-entry after device lock.
Sensitivity of Actions & Permission Levels:

Task assignment: Restricted to coordinators with appropriate training.
Incident escalation: Reserved for senior coordinators or government officials.
System configuration: Limited to IT administrators.
General status updates: Available to all authenticated field personnel.
3. Non-Functional Requirements
Performance:

Must support up to 2,500 concurrent users during peak emergency scenarios, with response times under 3 seconds for 95% of actions.
Scalability:

Designed to scale rapidly for regional emergencies, doubling capacity within 24 hours if needed.
Reliability:

99.95% uptime with redundant infrastructure and disaster recovery capabilities, including failover within 15 minutes of an outage.
Security:

End-to-end encryption for all communications.
Role-based access control to ensure appropriate permissions.
Automated detection and alerting of suspicious activities, such as unauthorized access attempts.
Usability:

Mobile-first design with intuitive interfaces for field personnel operating in high-stress environments.
Adherence to WCAG 2.1 AA standards for accessibility.
Multilingual support for diverse user populations.
Audit & Monitoring:

Full audit logs of user actions, including authentication events, incident updates, and resource assignments, retained for 7 years.
Real-time monitoring of system performance and security metrics, with configurable alerts for anomalies.
4. Constraints
Technical Constraints:

The system must integrate with existing municipal communication tools and GIS platforms.
Designed to function on devices with limited processing power, such as older smartphones or ruggedized field tablets.
Compliance Requirements:

Must adhere to federal and state data protection regulations, including CCPA and state-specific emergency response mandates.
Audit trails must meet local government oversight standards.
Resource Constraints:

Initial budget of $3 million with a three-year implementation timeline.
Development team limited to 20 personnel, including developers, project managers, and domain experts.
Integration Needs:

Seamless integration with 911 dispatch systems and municipal ERP platforms for resource tracking.
APIs for data sharing with neighboring jurisdictions and federal emergency management systems.
This scenario presents a comprehensive and realistic example of a government-focused emergency response management system, addressing domain-specific challenges, goals, and constraints.
