Scenario: Digital Permit Management System for Municipal Services
1. System Overview
System Purpose:
The Digital Permit Management System (DPMS) aims to streamline the issuance, tracking, and management of permits for municipal services such as building construction, event hosting, and business operations. The system simplifies the application process, enhances transparency, and ensures compliance with local regulations.

Domain/Context:
Local government and public services, focusing on permitting and regulatory compliance. The system will replace outdated, paper-based workflows with a centralized digital platform.

Stakeholders:

Applicants: Citizens, contractors, and businesses applying for permits.
Municipal Employees: Permit reviewers, inspectors, and compliance officers.
Government Officials: City planners and department heads monitoring system performance and compliance.
IT Administrators: Responsible for system maintenance, security, and updates.
User Base Characteristics:

Size: Approximately 10,000 active users monthly, including 8,000 applicants and 2,000 municipal employees.
Diversity: Users range from tech-savvy professionals to individuals with minimal digital experience.
Geographic Distribution: Primarily within the city or county jurisdiction, with occasional external contractors.
Roles: Applicants, reviewers, inspectors, administrators, and decision-makers.
Operational Environment:

Cloud-based system accessible via web browsers and a mobile app for applicants and inspectors.
Municipal offices equipped with dedicated terminals for internal staff.
System supports multilingual interfaces to serve a diverse population.
Usage Scenarios:

Applicants submit permit requests online, track status, and respond to queries.
Municipal employees review applications, assign inspections, and approve or reject permits.
Inspectors upload reports directly from the field using mobile devices.
Administrators generate compliance reports and manage user permissions.
2. Functional Requirements
Core Features:

User-friendly permit application forms with dynamic field validation.
Automated notifications and reminders for pending actions (e.g., application status updates, inspection scheduling).
Real-time dashboards for tracking application volumes, processing times, and revenue collection.
Integrated GIS mapping for location-specific permit requirements.
Document management system for uploading, storing, and retrieving supporting files.
Authentication Conditions & Frequency:

Applicants authenticate at the start of each session, with sessions expiring after 30 minutes of inactivity.
Municipal employees require re-authentication for sensitive actions such as approving permits or modifying user permissions.
Inspectors must authenticate when submitting field reports or accessing restricted data.
Sensitivity of Actions & Permission Levels:

Permit approval: Restricted to senior municipal staff.
Inspection report submission: Restricted to certified inspectors.
System configuration changes: Accessible only to IT administrators.
Public application submissions: Open to authenticated users with minimal role-based restrictions.
3. Non-Functional Requirements
Performance:

System must process up to 1,000 concurrent users with response times under 2 seconds for 95% of actions.
Scalability:

Designed to accommodate a 30% annual increase in users and application volumes without performance degradation.
Reliability:

99.9% uptime with automated failover mechanisms and nightly data backups.
Security:

Encrypted communication for all data exchanges (TLS 1.3).
Role-based access control to ensure least privilege.
Data masking for sensitive applicant information during internal reviews.
Usability:

Compliance with WCAG 2.1 AA standards to ensure accessibility for users with disabilities.
Intuitive interface with context-sensitive help and multilingual support.
Audit & Monitoring:

Comprehensive logging of user actions, including authentication events, with audit trails maintained for 7 years.
Real-time alerts for suspicious activity, such as repeated failed login attempts or unauthorized data access.
4. Constraints
Technical Constraints:

The system must integrate with existing municipal databases (e.g., tax and zoning systems).
Hosted on a government-approved cloud platform adhering to FedRAMP standards.
Compliance Requirements:

Adherence to local data protection laws and federal privacy regulations (e.g., CCPA).
Audit processes must align with municipal oversight policies.
Resource Constraints:

Initial development budget of $2 million with a two-year deployment timeline.
A core project team of 15 members, including developers, business analysts, and quality assurance specialists.
Integration Needs:

Seamless integration with the municipality's ERP system for financial reporting and billing.
API support for third-party contractors to connect external scheduling and tracking tools.
This scenario provides a realistic and sector-appropriate view of a government software system, ensuring alignment with industry challenges and constraints.
