Scenario: Digital Case Management System for Social Services
1. System Overview
System Purpose:
The Digital Case Management System (DCMS) is designed to streamline the intake, assessment, and resolution processes for social service cases. Its goal is to enhance efficiency, reduce paperwork, and provide a centralized repository for case information, enabling faster and more accurate decision-making for public service officers.

Domain/Context:
The system operates within the public welfare sector, specifically targeting government-run social service agencies responsible for providing assistance in housing, healthcare, financial aid, and family support.

Stakeholders:

Social Workers: Use the system to manage case files and track client interactions.
Administrators: Oversee operations, ensure compliance, and manage resource allocation.
Clients: Individuals seeking assistance interact with the system through a portal for applications, updates, and communication.
IT Staff: Responsible for system maintenance, security, and troubleshooting.
Auditors and Compliance Officers: Access the system for monitoring, reporting, and ensuring adherence to regulations.
User Base Characteristics:

Approximately 20,000 active users, including 15,000 social workers and administrators across multiple regions and 5,000 clients accessing the portal.
Geographic distribution spans urban, suburban, and rural areas, requiring offline capabilities for remote fieldwork.
User roles include case workers, supervisors, administrative staff, and external clients.
Operational Environment:

Hosted on a government-secured cloud infrastructure to allow nationwide access while ensuring data security.
Accessible via web and mobile applications optimized for low-bandwidth environments.
Designed for compatibility with government-issued devices.
Usage Scenarios:

A social worker logs in to create a new case, updates client details, and schedules an in-person visit.
Clients access the portal to submit required documentation and check the status of their applications.
Administrators generate reports on the number of resolved cases within a given time frame to evaluate performance metrics.
Auditors review case histories and user actions to ensure compliance with social service policies.
2. Functional Requirements
Core Features:

Case Intake and Management: Users can create, update, and close cases.
Document Upload and Verification: Clients and case workers upload supporting documents, verified by the system for completeness.
Communication Tools: Integrated messaging between clients and social workers.
Automated Workflows: Triggers for follow-ups, reminders, and escalation protocols.
Report Generation: Predefined and customizable reports for performance monitoring.
Authentication Conditions & Frequency:

Users must authenticate at the start of each session.
Re-authentication is required after 60 minutes of inactivity.
Sensitive actions, such as case closure or document approval, prompt immediate re-authentication.
Sensitivity of Actions & Permission Levels:

Case creation and updates: Limited to social workers and supervisors.
Case closures and approvals: Restricted to supervisors and administrators.
Access to audit logs: Available only to auditors and compliance officers.
3. Non-Functional Requirements
Performance:

The system must handle up to 1,000 concurrent users with response times under 2 seconds for standard queries.
Batch processing of large reports should complete within 30 minutes.
Scalability:

Must accommodate a 25% annual increase in users and a 50% increase in stored data volumes over five years.
Reliability:

99.95% uptime with failover mechanisms to ensure continuity during outages.
Automated backups every 4 hours with a recovery time objective (RTO) of 1 hour.
Security:

End-to-end encryption for all data in transit and at rest.
Role-based access control (RBAC) with periodic access reviews.
Usability:

Compliance with WCAG 2.1 AA for accessibility.
Simple, intuitive interfaces tailored for users with minimal technical expertise.
Audit & Monitoring:

Real-time logging of all user actions, including authentication events.
Monthly audit reports with anomaly detection and alerting for unusual access patterns.
4. Constraints
Technical Constraints:

The system must operate on government-approved cloud providers.
Integration required with the National Citizen Database for identity verification.
Compliance Requirements:

Must adhere to data protection laws such as GDPR and local privacy regulations.
Compliance with ISO 27001 standards for information security management.
Resource Constraints:

Development budget capped at $8 million over 24 months.
Core team of 30, including developers, business analysts, and quality assurance specialists.
Integration Needs:

Seamless data exchange with legacy case tracking systems during a phased migration.
APIs for integration with financial aid disbursement systems to automate payments.
This scenario provides a realistic, resource-appropriate, and sector-specific example of a government software project for public services.
