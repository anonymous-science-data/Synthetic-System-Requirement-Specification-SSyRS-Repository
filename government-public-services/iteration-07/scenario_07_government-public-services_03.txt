Scenario: Public Infrastructure Management System (PIMS)
1. System Overview
System Purpose:
The Public Infrastructure Management System (PIMS) is designed to centralize and streamline the planning, monitoring, and maintenance of public infrastructure projects, including roads, bridges, and water systems. The system aims to improve transparency, enhance collaboration across agencies, and ensure timely project delivery.

Domain/Context:
The system operates within the domain of public works and urban planning, supporting municipal and state governments in managing infrastructure projects efficiently and in compliance with regulatory standards.

Stakeholders:

Municipal Engineers: Use the system to track project progress and schedule inspections.
Urban Planners: Plan and prioritize infrastructure projects based on data-driven insights.
Government Officials: Monitor project statuses and allocate budgets.
Contractors and Vendors: Submit bids, manage contracts, and report progress.
Citizens: Access the portal to view project updates and report infrastructure issues.
Regulatory Agencies: Ensure compliance with safety and environmental regulations.
User Base Characteristics:

Estimated 30,000 active users, including engineers, planners, government officials, and contractors.
Approximately 500,000 citizens access the portal intermittently to check project updates or report issues.
Geographic distribution includes urban, suburban, and rural areas, requiring mobile access and offline capabilities for fieldwork.
Operational Environment:

Hosted on a government-approved hybrid cloud infrastructure, allowing secure access across regions.
Accessible via a web portal and mobile application.
Mobile access includes offline functionality for inspections and data entry in remote areas, with automatic synchronization when connectivity is restored.
Usage Scenarios:

An engineer logs in to schedule an inspection for a bridge and updates the status after completion.
A citizen reports a pothole via the mobile app, which triggers an alert for municipal review.
A contractor submits a progress report along with supporting documents for review by project managers.
A government official reviews budget allocations for ongoing projects and approves additional funding for a delayed project.
2. Functional Requirements
Core Features:

Project Management: Create, track, and update infrastructure projects, including timelines and budgets.
Issue Reporting: Citizens can report infrastructure problems, which are automatically routed to the relevant municipal department.
Bid and Vendor Management: Contractors submit bids, and project managers review and approve contracts.
Inspection Scheduling: Engineers can plan and record inspections with automated notifications for overdue tasks.
Reporting and Analytics: Generate performance metrics and compliance reports for projects.
Authentication Conditions & Frequency:

All users authenticate at the start of each session.
Re-authentication is required after 60 minutes of inactivity.
High-sensitivity actions, such as budget approvals or contract modifications, require immediate re-authentication.
Sensitivity of Actions & Permission Levels:

Project creation and budget allocation: Restricted to government officials.
Inspection updates: Accessible only to municipal engineers and contractors.
Bid submission and contract management: Limited to contractors and authorized reviewers.
Access to audit logs: Available exclusively to regulatory agencies and compliance officers.
3. Non-Functional Requirements
Performance:

The system must support up to 2,500 concurrent government users and 10,000 citizen portal sessions with response times under 3 seconds for standard queries.
Scalability:

Capable of handling a 20% annual increase in projects and a 50% increase in user base over the next five years.
Reliability:

99.9% uptime with robust failover mechanisms for critical services.
Automated backups every 6 hours with a recovery time objective (RTO) of 2 hours.
Security:

All data encrypted at rest and in transit.
Role-based access control (RBAC) with periodic reviews and automatic deactivation of inactive accounts.
Usability:

Intuitive user interfaces tailored to users with varying levels of technical expertise.
Compliance with WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility standards to ensure inclusivity.
Audit & Monitoring:

Comprehensive logging of user activities, including infrastructure updates, contract approvals, and system access.
Real-time anomaly detection with alerts for unauthorized access attempts.
4. Constraints
Technical Constraints:

Must integrate with existing municipal Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and budget tracking software.
Operates exclusively on government-approved cloud infrastructure with limited customization options.
Compliance Requirements:

Adherence to local and national regulations for environmental impact assessments and infrastructure safety.
Compliance with ISO 27001 and data protection laws, including GDPR where applicable.
Resource Constraints:

Development budget of $12 million over 30 months, with additional $2 million allocated for scaling and maintenance.
Core team of 40 members, including developers, GIS specialists, and compliance experts.
Integration Needs:

Seamless integration with public-facing portals for citizen access and issue reporting.
APIs for interoperability with contractor management platforms and project planning tools.
This scenario is designed to address the challenges of managing public infrastructure projects effectively while considering the constraints and requirements typical of Government and Public Services systems.
