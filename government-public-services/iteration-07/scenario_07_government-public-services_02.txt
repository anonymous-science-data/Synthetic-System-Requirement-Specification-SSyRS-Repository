Scenario: Integrated Public Health Records Management System
1. System Overview
System Purpose:
The Integrated Public Health Records Management System (PHRMS) is designed to centralize, digitize, and streamline the management of health records for public health programs. Its primary goals are to enhance record accessibility, improve data sharing among healthcare providers, and ensure compliance with government health reporting requirements.

Domain/Context:
The system operates in the healthcare sector within public services, supporting national health initiatives and programs such as vaccination campaigns, disease tracking, and community health assessments.

Stakeholders:

Healthcare Workers: Medical professionals and support staff who access and update patient health records.
Public Health Administrators: Oversee health program performance, compliance, and resource allocation.
Citizens: Individuals accessing their health records through a public portal.
IT Support Staff: Maintain the system's infrastructure and ensure security.
Regulatory Bodies: Conduct audits and ensure the system complies with public health and data protection laws.
User Base Characteristics:

Estimated 50,000 active users, including 35,000 healthcare professionals and 15,000 administrators across the country.
Citizens (approximately 1 million) access the portal intermittently to view vaccination status or health reports.
Users are distributed nationwide, including rural and urban areas, requiring mobile and offline capabilities for remote regions.
Operational Environment:

Cloud-hosted system on a government-approved platform with national coverage.
Accessible via web browsers, mobile applications, and government-issued devices.
Offline access for remote healthcare workers, with data syncing when connectivity is restored.
Usage Scenarios:

A nurse updates a patient's vaccination status during an outreach program in a rural area using offline functionality.
A citizen logs into the portal to view their vaccination certificate for school admission.
An administrator generates a report on vaccination coverage in a specific district for program planning.
A regulator reviews audit logs to verify compliance with public health standards.
2. Functional Requirements
Core Features:

Health Record Management: Create, update, and retrieve patient records.
Public Portal Access: Citizens can view personal health data and download certificates.
Data Integration: Synchronize data with existing electronic health records (EHR) systems.
Analytics and Reporting: Generate health statistics and compliance reports.
Alerts and Notifications: Automated reminders for upcoming vaccinations or pending actions.
Authentication Conditions & Frequency:

Users authenticate at the start of each session.
Re-authentication is required after 90 minutes of inactivity.
High-sensitivity actions, such as modifying health records or generating official reports, prompt immediate re-authentication.
Sensitivity of Actions & Permission Levels:

Record creation and updates: Restricted to healthcare workers.
Report generation: Limited to administrators and authorized staff.
Access to audit logs: Available only to regulatory bodies.
3. Non-Functional Requirements
Performance:

The system must handle up to 5,000 concurrent healthcare worker sessions and 2,000 citizen portal sessions with response times under 3 seconds for standard queries.
Scalability:

Support a 30% annual increase in users and a 50% increase in stored health records over five years.
Reliability:

99.9% uptime with redundancy mechanisms to ensure service continuity.
Automated backups every 4 hours, with an RTO of 2 hours.
Security:

All data encrypted in transit and at rest.
Role-based access control (RBAC) and periodic access reviews.
Usability:

Interfaces designed for low-tech literacy users, including simplified data entry workflows for healthcare workers.
Compliance with WCAG 2.1 AA standards for accessibility.
Audit & Monitoring:

Detailed logs of all user actions, including health record modifications and report generation.
Real-time alerts for unauthorized access attempts or unusual data patterns.
4. Constraints
Technical Constraints:

Must integrate with legacy EHR systems already in use at state and local levels.
Operates exclusively on government-approved cloud providers.
Compliance Requirements:

Must comply with GDPR, local health data protection laws, and ISO 27001 standards for information security.
Adherence to public health program guidelines for data collection and reporting.
Resource Constraints:

Budget of $15 million allocated over a 36-month development timeline.
Core team of 50 members, including developers, data specialists, and domain experts.
Integration Needs:

Seamless integration with national immunization databases and local EHR systems.
APIs for third-party applications to access anonymized public health data for research.
This scenario provides a realistic and domain-appropriate design for a public health records management system in the Government and Public Services sector.
