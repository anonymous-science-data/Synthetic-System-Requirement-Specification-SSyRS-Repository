Synthetic System Requirements Specification (SSRS): Intermodal Freight Optimization & Tracking Platform (IFOTP)

1. System Overview
System Purpose:
The Intermodal Freight Optimization & Tracking Platform (IFOTP) is designed to optimize, coordinate, and monitor intermodal freight transport operations across rail, road, and maritime modalities. The platform provides real-time visibility into cargo location, condition, and estimated time of arrival (ETA), while supporting scheduling, load balancing, and predictive rerouting based on environmental and logistical factors.

Domain/Context:
Logistics and Transportation - specifically intermodal freight logistics involving the movement of shipping containers and goods through multiple modes of transport.

Stakeholders:

Freight Forwarders

Port Authorities

Rail Operators

Trucking Companies

Logistics Managers

Customs Agencies

System Administrators

Maintenance Teams

User Base Characteristics:

Size: ~15,000 active users

Roles: Operations Coordinators, Transport Schedulers, Customs Officers, Data Analysts, Logistics Executives, Field Inspectors

Geographic Distribution: Primarily North America and Western Europe, with port and terminal integrations in East Asia

Diversity: Multilingual users with varied digital literacy levels

Operational Environment:

Hybrid cloud-based deployment (Azure + on-premise terminal nodes)

Web application with mobile support for field operations

Integrated with IoT devices (e.g., GPS, RFID, and temperature sensors) and port logistics systems

Usage Scenarios:

A rail operator schedules a container pickup from a maritime terminal and adjusts routing based on forecasted port congestion.

A customs agent verifies documentation and flags a container for inspection, triggering delay notifications and dynamic ETA recalculation.

A logistics manager monitors temperature anomalies in real-time for perishable goods in transit and initiates corrective actions.

2. Functional Requirements
Core Features:

Route Optimization Engine: Dynamic planning based on real-time data from ports, traffic, and weather systems

Multi-Modal ETA Forecasting: Predictive algorithms factoring delays across rail, road, and sea

Asset Tracking Interface: Visual dashboards for container location, status, and cargo conditions

Load Consolidation Management: Tools for identifying efficient container groupings based on volume, destination, and cargo compatibility

Alerting System: Configurable alerts for delays, environmental threshold breaches, or customs flags

Document Management Module: Digital customs, compliance, and manifest documentation tied to each shipment

Collaborative Scheduling Workspace: Shared environment for stakeholders to coordinate container hand-offs

Multi-Language Support: Interfaces available in English, French, Spanish, Mandarin

Authentication Conditions & Frequency:

Session authentication required every 12 hours or upon accessing from a new device

Re-authentication required for:

Modifying transport plans

Approving customs documentation

Viewing sensitive cargo metrics (e.g., high-value or hazardous materials)

Initiating data exports or reports

Sensitivity of Actions & Permission Levels:

Low Sensitivity: Dashboard viewing, general ETA checks (Accessible to all roles)

Moderate Sensitivity: Schedule editing, customs form submissions (Logistics Coordinators, Customs Officers)

High Sensitivity: Rerouting operations, temperature override commands, and access to audit logs (Admins, Senior Logistics Executives)

3. Non-Functional Requirements
Performance:

95% of API calls must respond within 2 seconds under normal load

ETA predictions to update within 15 seconds of receiving new location data

Scalability:

Must support a 3x user growth over 5 years, including new IoT device onboarding without performance degradation

Elastic compute for data processing workloads and real-time analytics

Reliability:

99.95% uptime SLA

Automatic failover for regional nodes

Offline caching for mobile users in low-connectivity areas

Security:

Role-based access control (RBAC)

Encrypted data in transit and at rest (AES-256)

Daily security audits of API endpoints

Restricted IP access for administrative actions

Usability:

Responsive design for field devices

Accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 Level AA)

Contextual help and user training guides integrated into UI

Audit & Monitoring:

Immutable audit trail for all schedule changes, document submissions, and permission escalations

Real-time monitoring of API usage and user sessions

Weekly anomaly reports for suspicious access patterns

4. Constraints
Technical Constraints:

Must operate with container terminals using legacy systems (e.g., EDI-based port communication)

Requires compatibility with third-party telematics systems from multiple vendors

Compliance Requirements:

GDPR (for operations in EU)

C-TPAT and ISO 28000 compliance for international freight security

Local port authority data-sharing regulations (e.g., Singapore Maritime Data Hub standards)

Resource Constraints:

Budget: USD 11.5 million (initial development + 3 years operation)

Timeline: 20 months (15 months development, 5 months pilot rollout)

Team: ~35 core personnel (Project Managers, DevOps, Data Scientists, Frontend & Backend Developers, QA, and Domain SMEs)

Integration Needs:

Integrate with existing port operation systems (Navis N4, TOS+)

Interface with customs clearance platforms (e.g., ICEGATE India, ACE U.S.)

Synchronize with partner APIs for weather and traffic data (e.g., OpenWeatherMap, HERE Technologies)
