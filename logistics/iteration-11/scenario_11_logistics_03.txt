Synthetic System Requirements Specification (SSRS): Hazardous Materials Logistics Compliance & Incident Reporting System (HazMat-CIRS)

1. System Overview
System Purpose:
The Hazardous Materials Logistics Compliance & Incident Reporting System (HazMat-CIRS) is designed to support safe, compliant transportation and real-time incident reporting for hazardous materials (hazmat) shipments across multimodal logistics networks. The system centralizes compliance documentation, monitors transport conditions, and enables immediate response coordination in the event of containment breaches, exposure risks, or regulatory violations.

Domain/Context:
Specialized Logistics - focusing on regulated transport of dangerous goods (chemicals, flammable substances, radioactive materials) by land, sea, and air.

Stakeholders:

Dangerous Goods Safety Advisors (DGSAs)

Logistics Compliance Officers

Regulatory Inspectors (e.g., DOT, EASA, IMO, local authorities)

Fleet Operations Managers

Hazmat Carriers and Drivers

Emergency Response Coordinators

System Administrators

User Base Characteristics:

Size: ~1,800 core users

Roles: Compliance specialists, dispatchers, drivers, incident investigators, admins

Geographic Distribution: European Union, United States, and Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) regions

Diversity: Includes certified hazmat handlers, multilingual compliance personnel, and mobile field operators

Operational Environment:

Private-cloud deployment across EU and U.S. for data sovereignty

Mobile-enabled field app for inspection logging and incident capture

Web-based control panels for compliance teams and regulatory auditors

Real-time API access for external emergency systems (e.g., 112/911 dispatch, HazMat mutual aid networks)

Usage Scenarios:

A DGSA uploads a transport manifest and receives automated validation against ADR/49 CFR/IATA-DGR requirements.

A driver detects a chemical leak and initiates an emergency alert through the mobile app, triggering downstream notifications.

A compliance officer audits a shipment's chain of custody and generates a regulatory-compliant report with logged GPS traces and sensor logs.

A regulator issues a corrective action request after inspecting an incomplete safety declaration.

2. Functional Requirements
Core Features:

Manifest Validation Engine: Automatically checks transport documentation against country-specific hazmat transport regulations

Incident Capture Module: Mobile interface for reporting leaks, exposure, and near-misses with photos, GPS, and timestamp data

Live Compliance Dashboard: Displays shipments at risk of non-compliance and overdue documentation

Corrective Action Workflow: Tracks responses to violations, including resolution approvals and due dates

Sensor Feed Integration: Ingests real-time temperature, vibration, and chemical leak sensor data from in-vehicle IoT units

Regulatory Audit Package Generator: Produces time-stamped, immutable audit records formatted to regional authority requirements

Multilingual User Interface: Available in English, German, French, and Arabic

Role-Based Access Controls: Ensures field visibility is limited to assigned regions and responsibilities

Authentication Conditions & Frequency:

Session authentication every 8 hours or upon device switch

Re-authentication is required for:

Submitting official incident reports

Approving corrective actions

Exporting shipment compliance audit packages

Changing transport regulation profiles

Sensitivity of Actions & Permission Levels:

Low Sensitivity: Viewing route progress or sensor logs (Drivers, Fleet Supervisors)

Moderate Sensitivity: Incident reporting, manifest submissions (Field Inspectors, DGSAs)

High Sensitivity: Compliance violation resolutions, regulatory reporting, data exports (Compliance Officers, Admins)

3. Non-Functional Requirements
Performance:

Manifest validation engine must respond in under 3 seconds for documents up to 50 pages

Incident reports must sync within 5 seconds after submission under 4G or better network conditions

Scalability:

Must support expansion to 5,000 users and 20,000 monitored shipments/month over the next 4 years

Elastic cloud resources for peak audit or reporting cycles (e.g., end-of-quarter compliance runs)

Reliability:

99.95% availability with regional failover

Offline mobile logging for incident capture; auto-sync when connectivity resumes

Redundant, immutable log storage for 10 years as per regulatory requirements

Security:

Region-based data segregation

Full encryption in transit and at rest (TLS 1.3, AES-256)

Granular RBAC and geo-fencing for user actions

Session-level anomaly detection with logging of unauthorized access attempts

Usability:

Streamlined forms for incident capture with auto-fill from manifest data

Accessible design standards for vision-impaired field workers (WCAG 2.1 AA compliant)

Contextual help and regulation references integrated into each interface panel

Audit & Monitoring:

All user actions logged immutably with traceable references to manifest IDs

Scheduled and on-demand audit trail exports

Automated alerts for missed documentation deadlines, unresolved violations, and delayed responses

4. Constraints
Technical Constraints:

Must operate with limited connectivity in remote border regions or port zones

Sensor data must be compatible with legacy CAN bus and modern telematics standards (e.g., FMS, ISO 11898)

Compliance Requirements:

Full adherence to ADR (EU), 49 CFR (U.S.), IATA-DGR (air transport), and GHS labeling standards

GDPR and local data sovereignty compliance for EU-hosted user data

Regulatory logging standards for hazardous materials transportation (e.g., PHMSA, EASA, IMO)

Resource Constraints:

Budget: USD 9.2 million across 3 years

Timeline: 18-month development cycle with pilot phase starting in month 14

Team: 32 FTEs including compliance SMEs, software developers, cloud architects, mobile engineers, QA testers, legal advisors, and support personnel

Integration Needs:

Integration with existing Transport Management Systems (TMS) used by large 3PLs

Sensor ingestion via MQTT and HTTPS from third-party telemetry providers

Export interfaces for regulatory platforms (e.g., EU Safety Gate, U.S. PHMSA, GCC Unified Transport Authority)
