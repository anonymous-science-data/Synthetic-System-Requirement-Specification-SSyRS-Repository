Synthetic System Requirements Specification (SSRS): Last-Mile Delivery Route Intelligence & Capacity Matching System (LDRICMS)

1. System Overview
System Purpose:
The Last-Mile Delivery Route Intelligence & Capacity Matching System (LDRICMS) enables dynamic route optimization and load capacity matching for urban and suburban last-mile delivery fleets. The system improves delivery efficiency by intelligently assigning packages to couriers based on current traffic, vehicle type, load limits, delivery deadlines, and real-time road constraints (e.g., closures, weather events).

Domain/Context:
Urban Logistics & E-commerce Delivery - focusing on last-mile fulfillment networks supporting retailers, courier companies, and third-party logistics providers (3PLs).

Stakeholders:

Fleet Managers

Independent Couriers

Retail Dispatchers

3PL Route Planners

Urban Logistics Coordinators

IT Operations Team

City Regulatory Bodies (e.g., traffic & emissions monitoring units)

User Base Characteristics:

Size: Approximately 4,000 active users

Roles: Dispatchers, Drivers, Planners, Admins, Analysts

Geographic Distribution: Primarily Southeast Asia and South America (focus on urban areas in Sao Paulo, Jakarta, Bangkok, and Manila)

Diversity: Includes tech-savvy logistics planners and non-technical, field-based independent couriers

Operational Environment:

Fully cloud-hosted (AWS multi-region deployment)

Mobile-first application for delivery personnel (Android, iOS)

Web-based dashboard for planners and analysts

REST APIs for integration with partner logistics platforms and traffic systems

Usage Scenarios:

A dispatcher uploads new delivery orders; the system generates optimized routes for 75 urban drivers based on load, delivery windows, and traffic.

A courier receives a live reroute notification due to a traffic jam and updates delivery ETAs via the mobile app.

A logistics analyst reviews delivery performance metrics and on-time percentage for a regional fleet.

A regional manager triggers a capacity request to crowdsource additional couriers when delivery density spikes.

2. Functional Requirements
Core Features:

Dynamic Route Optimization Engine: Routes generated in real-time using traffic, weather, and delivery time windows

Load-to-Capacity Matching Module: Automatically pairs shipments with vehicles/couriers based on volume, weight, and route density

Delivery Exception Handling: Workflow tools for reporting delivery failures, delays, and customer rescheduling

Crowdsourced Capacity Integration: Real-time onboarding of external couriers for surge periods

Zone-Based Rule Management: Area-specific constraints (e.g., low-emission zones, vehicle type restrictions)

Predictive Delay Forecasting: Machine learning models alert dispatchers of expected lateness based on historic and real-time data

Mobile App for Drivers: Task list, navigation integration, status updates, proof-of-delivery capture (photos, notes)

Fleet Performance Analytics Dashboard: KPIs, heatmaps, bottleneck trends for planners and managers

Authentication Conditions & Frequency:

Users must re-authenticate every 10 hours or when switching between mobile and web interfaces

Re-authentication triggered before:

Manual rerouting of assigned deliveries

Exporting regional performance data

Updating driver permissions or delivery area restrictions

Sensitivity of Actions & Permission Levels:

Low Sensitivity: Route viewing, task progress updates (Drivers, Dispatchers)

Moderate Sensitivity: Rerouting, delivery reassignment (Fleet Coordinators, Dispatchers)

High Sensitivity: Capacity overrides, API key management, city zone reconfiguration (Regional Admins, System Admins)

3. Non-Functional Requirements
Performance:

Route optimization jobs must complete within 4 seconds for fleets up to 100 vehicles

Mobile app must load route lists and delivery data within 2 seconds on 4G networks

Scalability:

System must scale to support 10,000 concurrent users and 2 million deliveries/day

Autoscaling compute infrastructure to support seasonal spikes (e.g., holiday shopping)

Reliability:

Minimum 99.9% uptime (excluding planned maintenance)

Offline fallback for mobile app: cached routes, task completion, and resync upon reconnection

Redundant failover zones across primary regions (Asia-Pacific, South America)

Security:

Role-based access control (RBAC)

Data encrypted at rest and in transit (TLS 1.3, AES-256)

IP-based restrictions for administrative endpoints

Geo-fencing to detect anomalous access from unexpected regions

Usability:

App localized in Portuguese, Bahasa Indonesia, Thai, and English

Mobile UI designed for single-handed use with minimal training required

Web interface supports keyboard navigation and screen readers (WCAG 2.1 AA)

Audit & Monitoring:

Delivery actions, reroutes, and zone changes logged immutably

Weekly audit summaries for sensitive operations (e.g., permission changes)

Real-time alerting for usage anomalies or unexpected API surges

4. Constraints
Technical Constraints:

Must support integration with OpenStreetMap-based navigation systems for countries with limited Google Maps availability

Offline-first design for mobile app due to connectivity variability in Southeast Asia

Compliance Requirements:

Comply with Brazil's LGPD and Indonesia's PDP laws regarding data residency and privacy

Comply with city-level emissions reporting requirements where low-emission zones apply (e.g., Jakarta Smart City regulations)

Resource Constraints:

Budget: USD 6.5 million over 2.5 years

Timeline: 9 months for MVP, full rollout by 24 months

Team: ~28 FTEs including Mobile/Web Developers, Cloud Engineers, Data Scientists, UX Designers, QA Engineers, and Product Owners

Integration Needs:

Integration with traffic data providers (HERE Maps, Waze for Cities)

API support for major e-commerce and logistics platforms (e.g., Shopify, SAP TM, Oracle WMS)

Webhook support for delivery confirmation and event triggers
