Logistics System Scenario: Warehouse Inventory and Distribution Management System
1. System Overview
System Purpose:
The system is designed to streamline warehouse operations by providing real-time inventory tracking, automated order fulfillment, and efficient distribution planning. The goal is to minimize inventory errors, optimize storage space utilization, and ensure timely dispatch of goods.

Domain/Context:
The system operates in the logistics and supply chain domain, specifically focusing on warehouses serving retail, manufacturing, and e-commerce sectors.

Stakeholders:

Warehouse Managers: Oversee inventory levels, storage optimization, and dispatch schedules.
Inventory Clerks: Update stock levels, conduct audits, and manage inbound shipments.
Pickers and Packers: Use mobile devices to locate and pack orders efficiently.
Logistics Coordinators: Plan and manage outbound distribution.
Administrators: Configure system settings and ensure compliance.
User Base Characteristics:

Size: Around 5,000 daily active users, including warehouse staff and logistics teams.
Diversity: A mix of office-based users (managers and coordinators) and floor staff (pickers, packers, and clerks) using handheld devices.
Geographic Distribution: Users spread across multiple warehouses in North America and Europe.
Roles: Includes administrators, managers, clerks, pickers/packers, and logistics planners.
Operational Environment:

Cloud-hosted system accessible via web portals for managers and mobile applications for floor staff.
Offline functionality for mobile apps to accommodate warehouses with intermittent internet connectivity.
Integration with barcode scanners and RFID readers for efficient data input.
Usage Scenarios:

Inbound Shipment Processing: Inventory clerks receive goods, scan barcodes, and update stock levels in real-time.
Order Fulfillment: Pickers use mobile devices to locate items in the warehouse, verify orders, and hand them off to packers.
Inventory Audits: Warehouse managers schedule periodic inventory checks, and clerks validate stock levels using mobile devices.
Outbound Distribution Planning: Logistics coordinators optimize dispatch schedules and generate shipping labels.
2. Functional Requirements
Core Features:

Real-Time Inventory Management: Updates on stock levels and item locations.
Order Fulfillment Workflow: Guides for pickers/packers with step-by-step instructions.
Distribution Scheduling: Tools to plan and optimize shipment routes.
Barcode and RFID Integration: Seamless data capture for inbound/outbound shipments.
Inventory Analytics: Reports on stock turnover rates, item demand, and space utilization.
Authentication Conditions & Frequency:

Floor staff authenticate at the start of their shifts and reauthenticate if idle for more than 30 minutes.
Managers and coordinators authenticate every 12 hours or when accessing sensitive financial or distribution data.
Administrators reauthenticate before making system-wide or configuration changes.
Sensitivity of Actions & Permission Levels:

High Sensitivity: Adding or removing inventory records, accessible to administrators and managers only.
Medium Sensitivity: Modifying order fulfillment details or shipment schedules (coordinator role).
Low Sensitivity: Viewing item locations or order statuses (picker/packer role).
3. Non-Functional Requirements
Performance:

Inventory updates must reflect within 2 seconds of barcode/RFID scans.
System can handle 10,000 concurrent stock queries without performance degradation.
Scalability:

Ability to scale for new warehouses and a 25% annual increase in order volume.
Reliability:

99.9% uptime SLA with automated failover mechanisms.
Data synchronization between offline and online modes within 10 minutes of reconnecting.
Security:

Encrypted data transmission and role-based access control.
Secure storage of sensitive data such as pricing and supplier details.
Usability:

Intuitive mobile interface requiring minimal training for floor staff.
Web portal optimized for large-screen devices and high data visibility.
Audit & Monitoring:

Logging of inventory updates, order modifications, and user activity.
Alerts for unauthorized access attempts or unusual inventory changes.
4. Constraints
Technical Constraints:

Mobile applications must support Android and iOS platforms.
Offline functionality must work seamlessly with barcode and RFID scanning devices.
Compliance Requirements:

GDPR compliance for warehouses operating in Europe.
Adherence to ISO 9001 standards for inventory management processes.
Resource Constraints:

Project budget limited to $2 million with a 14-month development timeline.
Dedicated team of 20 members, including developers, QA engineers, and logistics consultants.
Integration Needs:

Integration with existing ERP systems (e.g., SAP, Oracle) for order and financial data synchronization.
Compatibility with third-party logistics systems for distribution planning.
This scenario balances realistic operational goals, technical features, and constraints while addressing common logistics industry challenges such as inventory accuracy, operational efficiency, and compliance.
