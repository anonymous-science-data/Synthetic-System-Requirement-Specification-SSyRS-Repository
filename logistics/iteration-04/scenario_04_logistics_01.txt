Scenario: Logistics Management and Optimization System
1. System Overview
System Purpose:
The primary objective of the system is to streamline and optimize the logistics operations of a mid-to-large scale distribution company. This includes real-time tracking, route optimization, warehouse inventory management, and seamless communication across stakeholders to reduce costs and improve operational efficiency.

Domain/Context:
The system operates in the logistics and supply chain industry, serving companies involved in goods distribution, retail supply chains, and e-commerce.

Stakeholders:

Primary Users: Logistics managers, warehouse supervisors, and fleet operators.
Secondary Users: Delivery drivers, inventory clerks, and customer service representatives.
Indirect Beneficiaries: End customers and partner businesses who benefit from faster deliveries and reduced operational errors.
User Base Characteristics:

Size: Approximately 500 primary users, scaling to 10,000 indirect users (drivers, clerks, customers).
Diversity: Multilingual workforce distributed across multiple geographic locations, including urban and rural hubs.
Roles: Users range from tech-savvy logistics planners to field operators with minimal digital literacy.
2. Functional Requirements
Core Features:

Real-time fleet tracking and monitoring using GPS integration.
Automated route optimization based on traffic, weather, and delivery priority.
Centralized dashboard for warehouse inventory, order status, and performance analytics.
Mobile app for delivery drivers to update statuses, access optimized routes, and communicate with dispatchers.
Integration with ERP systems for seamless order and invoicing management.
Frequency of Authentication:

Logistics Managers: Per session or after periods of inactivity.
Drivers and Field Staff: Authentication required once daily, with biometric verification at key checkpoints (e.g., loading/unloading).
Sensitivity of Actions:

High Sensitivity: Approving shipment modifications, altering delivery schedules, and accessing inventory audit trails.
Moderate Sensitivity: Viewing order details and current delivery statuses.
Low Sensitivity: Updating delivery progress or basic inventory counts.
3. Non-Functional Requirements
Performance:

Response time for dashboard queries should not exceed 2 seconds.
System throughput must handle up to 50,000 transactions per hour during peak periods.
Scalability:

System must support 30% growth in user base and data load annually without performance degradation.
Reliability:

System uptime should be 99.9%, with automated error detection and recovery mechanisms.
Ability to recover from failures within 5 minutes to ensure continuous operations.
Security:

Data encryption at rest and in transit.
Role-based access control (RBAC) to prevent unauthorized actions.
Regular security audits and compliance with ISO 27001 standards.
Usability:

Intuitive interfaces with multilingual support.
Minimal training required for field staff, with embedded tooltips and guides in mobile apps.
4. Constraints
Technical Constraints:

Limited network bandwidth in rural areas where warehouses and delivery points are located.
Existing reliance on legacy ERP systems for order management, requiring smooth integration.
Compliance Requirements:

Adherence to GDPR for data handling, given operations across the EU.
Compliance with ISO 28000 (Supply Chain Security Management).
Resource Constraints:

Initial development budget capped at $2 million.
A project timeline of 18 months for MVP delivery.
A development team of 20, including external consultants for specialized integrations.
Integration Needs:

Seamless connectivity with legacy ERP systems and external shipping platforms (e.g., FedEx, DHL APIs).
Compatibility with mobile and IoT devices used in warehouses and by drivers for real-time updates.
