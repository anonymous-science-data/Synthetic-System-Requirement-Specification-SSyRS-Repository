1. System Overview

System Purpose:
To optimize the transportation, storage, and distribution of goods through intelligent route planning, real-time tracking, and inventory management. The system aims to reduce operational costs, improve delivery times, and enhance supply chain visibility.

Domain/Context:
Logistics and supply chain management, specifically targeting freight, warehousing, and last-mile delivery operations.

Stakeholders:
Logistics managers, warehouse operators, delivery personnel, corporate clients (e.g., manufacturers, retailers), and end consumers.

User Base Characteristics:
The user base consists of approximately 10,000 users distributed globally, including diverse roles such as operations managers, drivers, warehouse staff, and business administrators. Users operate across urban and rural environments, often relying on mobile and desktop platforms for access.

2. Functional Requirements

Core Features:

Real-time GPS tracking of vehicles and shipments.
Automated route optimization considering traffic, weather, and delivery priorities.
Centralized dashboard for inventory and fleet management.
Push notifications and alerts for delays, route changes, or stock shortages.
Data analytics for performance monitoring and predictive logistics.
Frequency of Authentication:
Users must authenticate at the start of each session. Certain sensitive actions, such as modifying delivery routes or accessing financial data, require re-authentication.

Sensitivity of Actions:

High sensitivity: Financial transactions, changes to delivery priorities, and customer data access.
Medium sensitivity: Route adjustments, inventory updates.
Low sensitivity: Tracking shipment statuses.
3. Non-Functional Requirements

Performance:

Response time for user queries: <2 seconds.
Support for up to 1 million shipment status updates per minute during peak periods.
Scalability:

System must scale to accommodate a 50% increase in user base and 100% increase in transaction volume within three years.
Reliability:

99.9% uptime, with automated failover and data replication for disaster recovery.
Security:

End-to-end encryption for all data in transit and at rest.
Role-based access control to prevent unauthorized data manipulation.
Usability:

Intuitive interfaces with multilingual support.
Optimized for low-bandwidth environments to ensure accessibility in rural areas.
4. Constraints

Technical Constraints:

Must operate seamlessly on cloud-based infrastructure, specifically leveraging AWS and Microsoft Azure.
Mobile application compatibility with both iOS and Android devices.
Compliance Requirements:

GDPR compliance for European operations.
Adherence to industry standards such as ISO 27001 for information security.
Resource Constraints:

Development budget limited to $5 million annually.
Staffing constraints: A core team of 20 developers and 10 support staff.
