1. System Overview

System Purpose:
To streamline warehouse management and improve the efficiency of logistics operations by implementing automated inventory tracking, demand forecasting, and real-time order fulfillment.

Domain/Context:
The system operates within the logistics and warehousing domain, focusing on supply chain optimization for e-commerce, retail, and manufacturing industries.

Stakeholders:
Warehouse managers, inventory planners, delivery teams, procurement officers, and end consumers who rely on timely deliveries.

User Base Characteristics:
The system serves approximately 15,000 users globally, including operational staff, logistics coordinators, and administrative personnel. Users are located in multiple regions, with a mix of urban and rural locations, and access the system primarily via desktop interfaces, mobile apps, and IoT-enabled devices in warehouses.

2. Functional Requirements

Core Features:

Automated inventory monitoring through IoT sensors and RFID tags.
Predictive analytics for demand forecasting and stock replenishment.
Real-time order tracking and fulfillment updates.
Centralized dashboard for managing multiple warehouses.
Workflow automation for returns, damaged goods, and stock audits.
Frequency of Authentication:
Users authenticate once per session, with re-authentication required for high-risk actions such as stock transfer approvals or system-level changes.

Sensitivity of Actions:

High sensitivity: Accessing financial reports, modifying procurement plans, and adjusting stock levels.
Medium sensitivity: Viewing order fulfillment data and generating reports.
Low sensitivity: Checking inventory counts or shipment statuses.
3. Non-Functional Requirements
