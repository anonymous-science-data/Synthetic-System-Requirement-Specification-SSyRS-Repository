1. System Overview

System Purpose:
To improve supply chain visibility and efficiency by implementing a centralized platform for multimodal transport coordination, shipment status tracking, and predictive maintenance of fleet vehicles.

Domain/Context:
The system operates within the logistics and transportation sector, specifically focusing on businesses managing international and domestic freight via air, sea, road, and rail.

Stakeholders:
Freight forwarders, transportation managers, maintenance teams, logistics providers, and clients (businesses relying on timely and cost-effective freight delivery).

User Base Characteristics:
The user base comprises around 20,000 users, including geographically distributed operators, managers, and technicians. Roles vary across freight companies, third-party logistics (3PL) providers, and clients monitoring their shipments.

2. Functional Requirements

Core Features:

Integrated dashboard for real-time tracking of shipments across all transport modes.
Predictive analytics for fleet maintenance, minimizing downtime.
Dynamic route planning with contingency management for delays.
Notification system for shipment milestones and exceptions.
Document management for customs and regulatory paperwork.
Frequency of Authentication:
Users authenticate once per session, with additional verification required for sensitive actions, such as modifying shipment schedules or accessing regulatory documents.

Sensitivity of Actions:

High sensitivity: Accessing customs documentation, modifying shipment data, and approving route deviations.
Medium sensitivity: Viewing fleet maintenance records and shipment analytics.
Low sensitivity: Monitoring shipment progress and receiving notifications.
3. Non-Functional Requirements

Performance:

Response time: <1 second for shipment updates, <3 seconds for analytics queries.
Throughput: Handle up to 1 million tracking updates per hour during peak periods.
Scalability:

Must support a 75% increase in global shipment volume over five years.
Reliability:

Ensure 99.9% uptime with automated fault detection and failover mechanisms.
Security:

Implement end-to-end encryption for all shipment data and communications.
Multifactor authentication (MFA) for sensitive user roles, such as managers and compliance officers.
Usability:

Simplified interfaces for non-technical users, with contextual help and multilingual support.
Mobile-friendly design for use in the field by transportation teams.
4. Constraints

Technical Constraints:

Operate on a hybrid infrastructure, combining private cloud for sensitive data with public cloud for scalability.
Compatibility with existing vehicle telematics systems and customs management platforms.
Compliance Requirements:

Adhere to international trade regulations, including Incoterms and customs compliance (e.g., Automated Export System, AES).
Compliance with regional data privacy laws, such as GDPR and CCPA.
Resource Constraints:

Development budget capped at $7 million annually.
Core team of 25 developers, including specialists in transportation management systems.
Integration Needs:

Seamless integration with third-party fleet management systems and customs documentation platforms.
API support for external clients to access real-time shipment tracking and reporting.
