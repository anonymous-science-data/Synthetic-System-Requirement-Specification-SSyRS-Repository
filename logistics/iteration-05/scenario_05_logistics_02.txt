1. System Overview
System Purpose:
The system aims to streamline last-mile delivery operations by optimizing route planning, monitoring real-time delivery status, and enabling dynamic reallocation of resources. It reduces delivery times, improves customer satisfaction, and lowers operational costs.

Domain/Context:
This system operates in the logistics domain, specifically focusing on last-mile delivery for e-commerce and retail supply chains.

Stakeholders:

Delivery Managers: Oversee delivery operations and ensure efficiency.
Drivers: Use the system for optimized route guidance and updates.
Dispatch Coordinators: Allocate resources and handle real-time reassignments.
Customers: Receive accurate delivery time updates and notifications.
IT Teams: Manage the technical deployment and maintenance of the system.
User Base Characteristics:

Approximately 1,000-5,000 users, including delivery drivers, managers, and dispatchers.
Geographic distribution across urban and rural regions, including international locations.
Roles include real-time decision-making (managers), operational tasks (drivers), and customer service.
Operational Environment:

Hosted in the cloud for scalability and ease of deployment.
Accessible via mobile apps for drivers and web portals for managers and dispatchers.
Integrated with GPS systems and IoT-enabled tracking devices for real-time updates.
Usage Scenarios:

Dispatch coordinators create delivery schedules using automated route optimization algorithms.
Drivers receive updated routes based on traffic conditions and package priorities.
Customers track their delivery status in real-time via SMS or a mobile app.
Managers monitor delivery KPIs and adjust strategies based on real-time data.
2. Functional Requirements
Core Features:

Automated route optimization considering traffic, weather, and delivery priorities.
Real-time vehicle tracking and status updates.
Dynamic reallocation of deliveries based on changing conditions.
Customer-facing notifications with estimated delivery times.
Authentication Conditions & Frequency:

Drivers authenticate at the start of their shift using single sign-on (SSO) tied to their employee ID.
Managers and dispatchers use two-factor authentication (2FA) for sensitive actions like reassigning deliveries.
Session timeouts occur after 15 minutes of inactivity for web portals.
Sensitivity of Actions & Permission Levels:

Reassigning deliveries requires dispatcher-level permissions.
Modifying route optimization parameters is restricted to delivery managers.
Access to real-time vehicle tracking is limited to authorized personnel.
3. Non-Functional Requirements
Performance:

Route optimization must complete within 10 seconds for 1,000 delivery points.
Real-time updates to drivers and customers should have a latency of no more than 5 seconds.
Scalability:

Must handle an increase in users by 50% annually and support up to 10,000 simultaneous deliveries.
Reliability:

Ensure 99.95% uptime with redundancy mechanisms for critical operations.
Automatic recovery for failed processes within 1 minute.
Security:

End-to-end encryption for all data transmissions.
Compliance with regional data protection laws, such as GDPR and CCPA.
Usability:

Mobile app designed for hands-free operation by drivers, with voice-guided navigation.
Interfaces available in multiple languages to support global operations.
Audit & Monitoring:

Maintain a log of all route changes, delivery status updates, and user actions.
Generate alerts for unusual activities, such as unauthorized access attempts.
4. Constraints
Technical Constraints:

Must integrate with existing vehicle telematics systems and GPS hardware.
Compatible with 4G and 5G networks to ensure real-time updates in various regions.
Compliance Requirements:

Adhere to international data privacy regulations, including GDPR and CCPA.
Ensure safe usage standards for mobile apps operated by drivers to prevent distractions.
Resource Constraints:

Initial budget allocation of $5 million for development and deployment.
Limited availability of in-house technical expertise, requiring third-party consultants.
Integration Needs:

Seamless integration with existing logistics platforms, such as WMS and CRM systems.
API compatibility with third-party delivery marketplaces for coordinated operations.
