1. System Overview
System Purpose:
The system is designed to streamline fleet management for logistics companies by providing real-time vehicle tracking, maintenance scheduling, and fuel usage monitoring. Its primary goal is to enhance operational efficiency, reduce maintenance costs, and minimize delivery delays.

Domain/Context:
This system operates in the logistics and transportation industry, catering to companies managing medium-to-large fleets of delivery and freight vehicles.

Stakeholders:

Fleet Managers: Oversee vehicle utilization and maintenance schedules.
Drivers: Use the system for daily task updates and performance feedback.
Dispatchers: Allocate vehicles and monitor progress in real-time.
IT Administrators: Manage system integrations and troubleshoot issues.
Executives: Leverage analytics to inform strategic decisions on fleet optimization.
User Base Characteristics:

Approximately 500-2,000 users, including fleet managers, drivers, and dispatchers.
Geographically distributed across multiple regions with urban and rural operations.
Roles include strategic oversight (executives), operational control (fleet managers), and direct usage (drivers).
Operational Environment:

Cloud-based, accessible via web portals for managers and dispatchers, and mobile apps for drivers.
Integrated with GPS devices, telematics systems, and onboard diagnostic (OBD) tools.
Designed to work in both online and offline modes to handle areas with poor network connectivity.
Usage Scenarios:

Fleet managers review daily vehicle status and assign tasks based on real-time availability.
Drivers use the mobile app to log fuel usage, mileage, and any maintenance concerns.
Dispatchers monitor vehicle locations and reassign tasks as delivery priorities change.
Automated alerts notify managers of upcoming maintenance or performance anomalies.
2. Functional Requirements
Core Features:

Real-time vehicle tracking integrated with telematics data.
Automated maintenance scheduling based on mileage, usage, and OBD alerts.
Fuel consumption tracking with analytics for cost optimization.
Driver performance scoring based on adherence to schedules and fuel efficiency.
Authentication Conditions & Frequency:

Drivers authenticate via mobile apps at the start of each shift using SSO.
Fleet managers and dispatchers authenticate via web portals with 2FA for sensitive operations.
Sessions for all users expire after 20 minutes of inactivity.
Sensitivity of Actions & Permission Levels:

Modifying maintenance schedules is restricted to fleet managers.
Access to detailed telematics data is available only to authorized personnel.
Dispatchers can reassign tasks but cannot modify vehicle configuration settings.
3. Non-Functional Requirements
Performance:

Vehicle location updates should be displayed within 3 seconds of data capture.
Maintenance scheduling algorithms should process up to 5,000 vehicles in under 30 seconds.
Scalability:

Must support up to 10,000 vehicles and associated users within three years.
Reliability:

Ensure 99.9% uptime with failover capabilities for GPS and telematics integrations.
System should automatically recover from data transmission errors within 1 minute.
Security:

Data encryption in transit and at rest using AES-256.
Regular vulnerability assessments and penetration testing to ensure robust defenses.
Usability:

Mobile app with simple, driver-friendly interfaces, including voice commands for hands-free operation.
Web portal dashboards customizable for fleet managers' specific metrics.
Audit & Monitoring:

Detailed logs of vehicle activity, task assignments, and maintenance actions.
Alerts for unusual activities such as unauthorized access or unexpected vehicle movement.
4. Constraints
Technical Constraints:

Must integrate with existing GPS, telematics, and OBD devices from multiple vendors.
Operable on low-bandwidth connections for rural areas.
Compliance Requirements:

Adhere to regional transportation safety regulations and driver data privacy laws (e.g., GDPR).
Ensure system design complies with emissions reporting requirements where applicable.
Resource Constraints:

Initial development budget of $8 million with a 16-month deployment timeline.
Limited in-house expertise for OBD and telematics integration, requiring external consultancy.
Integration Needs:

Seamless API-based integration with existing ERP and warehouse management systems.
Compatibility with third-party analytics tools for advanced reporting.
