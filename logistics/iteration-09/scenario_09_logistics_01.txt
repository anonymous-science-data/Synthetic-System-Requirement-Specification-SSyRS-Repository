Logistics Software System Scenario
1. System Overview
System Purpose:
To provide a centralized Logistics Operations Management Platform (LOMP) for a mid-sized supply chain and freight company, enabling efficient coordination of inventory, warehousing, and transportation. The system aims to enhance real-time visibility into goods movement, automate scheduling and dispatching, and optimize resource utilization.

Domain/Context:
The logistics and supply chain domain, specifically focusing on medium-scale B2B freight services across multiple regions, with operations spanning warehouses, distribution centers, and third-party trucking companies.

Stakeholders:

Logistics Managers: Oversee overall operations and ensure timely delivery.
Warehouse Staff: Handle inventory and dispatch operations.
Drivers and Fleet Operators: Execute transportation schedules and report statuses.
Customers: B2B clients who track orders and request transportation updates.
IT Administrators: Maintain system integrity, availability, and security.
User Base Characteristics:

Size: Approximately 1,200 users, including 600 drivers, 300 warehouse staff, 100 logistics managers, 100 external B2B client representatives, and 100 IT administrators.
Diversity: Users range from tech-savvy managers to less technical warehouse and driver staff.
Geographic Distribution: Operations spread across four countries, with multilingual support required.
Roles: Includes role-specific permissions for logistics managers, operational staff, and external clients.
Operational Environment:

Cloud-hosted system with mobile access for drivers and warehouse staff.
Web-based portal for managers and clients.
APIs for integration with fleet GPS trackers and third-party transportation management systems.
Usage Scenarios:

Day-to-day tracking: Warehouse staff scan inventory and update the system during loading and unloading.
Dispatch coordination: Logistics managers schedule and monitor driver assignments in real-time.
Customer engagement: Clients log in to view shipment statuses, expected delivery times, and generate reports.
Incident handling: Drivers use the mobile app to report delays, accidents, or maintenance issues.
2. Functional Requirements
Core Features:

Real-time inventory tracking across warehouses.
Dynamic scheduling and dispatching system with route optimization.
Mobile application for drivers with GPS tracking, task updates, and incident reporting.
Client-facing web portal for shipment tracking, document generation, and support ticket submission.
Alerts and notifications for exceptions like delays, damaged goods, or missed deadlines.
Comprehensive reporting and analytics tools for logistics managers.
Authentication Conditions & Frequency:

Initial Login: Required at the start of each shift or session for all user roles.
Session Expiry: Automatic logout after 2 hours of inactivity for security purposes.
Re-authentication: Required for sensitive actions, such as editing schedules, accessing client data, or generating financial reports.
Sensitivity of Actions & Permission Levels:

Logistics Managers: High-level permissions for scheduling, accessing financial data, and overriding system recommendations.
Warehouse Staff: Limited access to inventory records and task-specific updates.
Drivers: Access to their own tasks, routes, and incident reporting.
Clients: View-only access to shipment statuses and report generation for their own orders.
3. Non-Functional Requirements
Performance:

System must handle up to 1,000 concurrent users with response times under 2 seconds for standard queries.
Capable of processing 5,000 inventory updates per minute during peak hours.
Scalability:

Ability to scale vertically and horizontally to support up to 50% growth in user base and transaction volumes over the next 5 years.
Reliability:

99.9% uptime with robust failover mechanisms for critical components like inventory and scheduling.
Automatic retries for failed transactions and daily data backups.
Security:

End-to-end encryption for all communications.
Strict role-based access control to minimize unauthorized data access.
Usability:

Intuitive interfaces for non-technical users, with mobile-friendly designs for on-the-go access.
Multilingual support for English, Spanish, and French.
Audit & Monitoring:

Comprehensive logging of user actions, especially for sensitive operations.
Automated alerts for unusual login patterns or failed authentication attempts.
4. Constraints
Technical Constraints:

Cloud infrastructure must conform to existing corporate IT policies.
APIs must support integration with legacy systems using RESTful standards.
Compliance Requirements:

Must adhere to GDPR and CCPA for data protection, as the company operates in both the EU and California.
Compliance with local transportation safety regulations in all operational regions.
Resource Constraints:

Project budget of $5 million for initial development and deployment, with annual maintenance costs capped at $500,000.
Development team includes 15 in-house engineers and 5 contractors specializing in logistics software.
Integration Needs:

Integration with fleet GPS providers for real-time tracking.
Connectivity with ERP systems for invoicing and client management.
