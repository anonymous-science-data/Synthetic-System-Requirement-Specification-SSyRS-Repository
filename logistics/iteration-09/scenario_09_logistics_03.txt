Logistics Software System Scenario
1. System Overview
System Purpose:
To develop an Integrated Fleet and Resource Management System (IFRMS) for a large-scale logistics company focused on intermodal transportation. The system's primary goal is to optimize fleet operations, monitor resource utilization, and reduce delivery times by streamlining cross-modal handoffs between road, rail, and sea freight.

Domain/Context:
The system operates in the intermodal logistics domain, serving a company specializing in bulk freight transportation, such as raw materials and industrial components, across international supply chains.

Stakeholders:

Fleet Managers: Oversee vehicle and equipment assignments.
Operations Planners: Coordinate schedules across transportation modes.
Maintenance Teams: Track and schedule preventative maintenance for vehicles and equipment.
Third-Party Transport Partners: Collaborate on intermodal transfers.
Clients: Monitor shipment progress and access delivery documentation.
Compliance Officers: Ensure adherence to regulatory and safety standards.
User Base Characteristics:

Size: Approximately 5,000 users, including 1,500 drivers, 500 operations planners, 500 fleet managers, 300 maintenance staff, 700 third-party partners, and 1,500 client representatives.
Diversity: Users range from highly technical planners to field personnel with minimal IT experience.
Geographic Distribution: International operations with users located across four continents.
Roles: Role-specific permissions for operational managers, maintenance teams, clients, and third-party partners.
Operational Environment:

Hosted on a global cloud infrastructure with regional data centers to ensure low latency.
Mobile and tablet apps for drivers and maintenance teams, desktop access for planners and fleet managers.
IoT integration for vehicle diagnostics, cargo sensors, and GPS tracking.
Usage Scenarios:

Fleet Monitoring: Fleet managers view real-time locations, diagnostics, and fuel efficiency data.
Intermodal Scheduling: Operations planners coordinate handoffs between trucks, railways, and ships.
Preventative Maintenance: Maintenance teams receive alerts on vehicle wear and proactively schedule repairs.
Shipment Tracking: Clients access dashboards to track shipment status and retrieve electronic delivery documents.
2. Functional Requirements
Core Features:

Real-time vehicle and equipment tracking using IoT sensors and GPS.
Dynamic scheduling and rerouting based on traffic, weather, and freight delays.
Maintenance alert system with repair history tracking and scheduling tools.
Client-facing dashboards for tracking shipments, estimated delivery times, and documentation downloads.
Integration with rail and port scheduling systems for seamless intermodal handoffs.
Predictive analytics for route optimization and demand forecasting.
Authentication Conditions & Frequency:

Initial Login: Required at the start of every work shift or system access session.
Session Expiry: Automatic logout after 4 hours of inactivity.
Re-authentication: Triggered for sensitive operations such as modifying schedules, accessing compliance reports, or overriding vehicle assignments.
Sensitivity of Actions & Permission Levels:

Fleet Managers: Full access to fleet data, scheduling, and operational overrides.
Operations Planners: Permissions to create, adjust, and monitor transportation schedules.
Maintenance Teams: Access to maintenance data, alert systems, and repair scheduling.
Third-Party Partners: Limited access to their assigned schedules and shipment details.
Clients: Read-only access to shipment tracking and documentation for their orders.
3. Non-Functional Requirements
Performance:

Support for up to 3,000 concurrent users with response times under 2 seconds for key operations.
Process up to 50,000 IoT data points per minute for vehicle diagnostics and environmental monitoring.
Scalability:

Scalability to support a 100% increase in shipments and fleet size over five years.
Expandable architecture to integrate additional transportation modes or regional hubs.
Reliability:

99.97% uptime with failover redundancy for critical systems like fleet tracking and scheduling.
Automatic data replication across regional data centers for disaster recovery.
Security:

Encrypted data storage and transmission with strict access controls.
Anomaly detection for unauthorized data access or unusual user behavior.
Usability:

Driver and maintenance apps with simplified interfaces to support non-technical users.
Multilingual support for English, Spanish, Chinese, and French to accommodate global operations.
Audit & Monitoring:

Full audit trails for vehicle assignments, schedule adjustments, and client data access.
Real-time dashboards for system health and user activity patterns.
4. Constraints
Technical Constraints:

IoT devices must adhere to existing telematics hardware specifications.
The system must integrate with legacy rail and port scheduling systems.
Compliance Requirements:

Must comply with international safety and transportation regulations (e.g., EU transport laws, US DOT standards).
Adherence to ISO 9001 and ISO 27001 for quality and information security management.
Resource Constraints:

Initial project budget of $15 million for development and deployment, with an annual operating cost of $2 million.
Development team of 30 engineers, including 10 specializing in IoT integration and analytics.
Integration Needs:

Integration with third-party systems for rail and port scheduling.
Compatibility with client ERP systems for automated order synchronization and documentation sharing.
