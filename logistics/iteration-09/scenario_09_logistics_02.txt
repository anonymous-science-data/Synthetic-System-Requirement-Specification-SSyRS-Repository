Logistics Software System Scenario
1. System Overview
System Purpose:
To develop a Warehouse Optimization and Freight Coordination System (WOFCS) for a regional logistics company specializing in e-commerce fulfillment. The system will streamline inventory management, enable real-time warehouse-to-delivery tracking, and optimize load distribution across multiple transportation hubs.

Domain/Context:
The system operates within the e-commerce logistics domain, focusing on fast, accurate order fulfillment and efficient last-mile delivery. It caters to regional businesses managing a high volume of small, individualized shipments.

Stakeholders:

Warehouse Supervisors: Oversee operations and manage staff allocation.
Pick-and-Pack Workers: Responsible for order preparation and shipping.
Delivery Drivers: Manage last-mile delivery and update delivery statuses.
E-commerce Clients: Track fulfillment progress and receive order updates.
IT Operations Team: Maintain system availability and support integrations.
User Base Characteristics:

Size: Approximately 2,500 users, including 1,000 warehouse staff, 800 delivery drivers, 300 supervisors, 200 client representatives, and 200 IT team members.
Diversity: Varying levels of technical proficiency, with most drivers and warehouse staff having minimal IT training.
Geographic Distribution: Operating across five cities, with plans for regional expansion.
Roles: Includes role-specific access for operational users, supervisors, and external clients.
Operational Environment:

Hosted on a hybrid cloud platform to balance cost and latency concerns.
Mobile apps for delivery drivers and warehouse staff, with a web-based interface for supervisors and clients.
Real-time IoT integration for inventory tracking and load management.
Usage Scenarios:

Order Fulfillment: Warehouse staff scan items, verify inventory, and prepare shipments.
Load Balancing: Supervisors use dashboards to allocate goods across multiple trucks for optimal delivery routes.
Real-Time Updates: Drivers update delivery statuses via the mobile app, triggering notifications to clients.
Client Reporting: E-commerce clients generate detailed reports on shipping performance and delivery timelines.
2. Functional Requirements
Core Features:

Advanced warehouse management system with real-time inventory and picking tools.
AI-driven route and load optimization engine for freight distribution.
Mobile applications for delivery drivers to manage delivery schedules and report issues.
Customer-facing dashboards for shipment tracking and performance insights.
Alerts for damaged goods, route delays, or inventory discrepancies.
Seamless integration with e-commerce platforms for automated order imports.
Authentication Conditions & Frequency:

Initial Login: Required daily for all users.
Session Expiry: Sessions terminate after 3 hours of inactivity to prevent unauthorized access.
Re-authentication: Triggered for actions such as modifying inventory records, creating custom reports, or overriding delivery routes.
Sensitivity of Actions & Permission Levels:

Supervisors: Access to all operational data, with permissions to adjust load plans and approve route overrides.
Warehouse Staff: Limited access to their assigned tasks and order preparation workflows.
Drivers: Access to their delivery schedules and status update tools.
Clients: View-only access to shipment tracking and analytics for their orders.
3. Non-Functional Requirements
Performance:

Must support 2,000 concurrent users with response times under 1 second for critical actions such as inventory scans.
Capable of processing 10,000 item scans and updates per minute during peak hours.
Scalability:

Scalable infrastructure to handle a 75% increase in shipments over three years.
Expandable to support up to 10 regional hubs without performance degradation.
Reliability:

99.95% uptime with automated failover mechanisms for inventory tracking and route optimization.
Redundancy for critical services like order synchronization and real-time notifications.
Security:

Role-based access control and encrypted data transmission to ensure data security.
Automated alerts for anomalous activity, such as large-scale data exports or failed authentication attempts.
Usability:

Easy-to-navigate mobile apps for drivers with simplified workflows for quick updates.
Multilingual support for English, Spanish, and Mandarin to accommodate diverse user demographics.
Audit & Monitoring:

Logging for all inventory transactions, route adjustments, and client data access.
Automated monitoring dashboards for system health and user activity patterns.
4. Constraints
Technical Constraints:

IoT devices must conform to existing hardware specifications for RFID and barcode scanners.
Hybrid cloud infrastructure must integrate seamlessly with on-premise systems at older warehouse facilities.
Compliance Requirements:

Must comply with GDPR, CCPA, and local transportation regulations in all operational areas.
Adherence to ISO 27001 for information security management.
Resource Constraints:

Project budget of $7 million for development and deployment, with an annual maintenance cost of $750,000.
Development team of 20 engineers, including 5 specializing in AI and route optimization.
Integration Needs:

Seamless integration with e-commerce platforms like Shopify and Magento.
Compatibility with third-party delivery tracking APIs and legacy ERP systems.
