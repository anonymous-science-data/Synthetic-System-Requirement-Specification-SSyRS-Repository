Logistics Software System Scenario
1. System Overview
System Purpose:
The system is designed to enhance last-mile delivery operations by providing real-time routing, package tracking, and delivery confirmation. It aims to improve operational efficiency, reduce delivery times, and enhance customer satisfaction in urban and suburban areas.

Domain/Context:
Urban logistics and last-mile delivery for sectors such as e-commerce, food delivery, and healthcare supply chains.

Stakeholders:

Delivery Drivers: Use the system for optimized routing and task management.
Dispatch Coordinators: Monitor delivery status and manage driver assignments.
Customers: Track package status and provide delivery instructions.
Business Owners: Gain insights into delivery performance and operational efficiency.
IT and Maintenance Teams: Ensure system functionality and address technical issues.
User Base Characteristics:

Size: Approximately 50,000 active users daily, including drivers, dispatchers, and customers.
Diversity: Users include tech-savvy coordinators and less technically skilled drivers.
Geographic Distribution: Operates in densely populated urban areas and less-connected suburban locations.
Roles: Dispatchers, drivers, system administrators, and customer-facing interfaces.
2. Functional Requirements
Core Features:

Real-time dynamic routing with traffic and weather data integration.
Mobile app for delivery drivers with route guidance and task updates.
Customer notifications for delivery windows and live package tracking.
Digital proof of delivery (e.g., electronic signature or photo confirmation).
Dashboard for dispatchers to monitor driver performance and manage exceptions.
Frequency of Authentication:

Per session for delivery drivers and dispatchers.
Per action for system administrators making critical updates (e.g., user management).
Sensitivity of Actions:

High Sensitivity: Access to customer data, delivery confirmation overrides, and driver assignment changes.
Medium Sensitivity: Route adjustments and task re-prioritization.
Low Sensitivity: Viewing package status and non-personalized data.
3. Non-Functional Requirements
Performance:

Route updates must be recalculated within 2 seconds.
Support for up to 500 concurrent route calculations per second during peak hours.
Scalability:

System must scale to support up to 100,000 daily deliveries during peak seasons.
Infrastructure capable of expanding for city-wide deployments across multiple regions.
Reliability:

Minimum uptime of 99.9%.
Automatic retries for failed route updates or delivery status changes.
Security:

Compliance with PCI DSS for handling customer payment details (if applicable).
Data encryption for all customer and delivery-related information.
Role-based access control to ensure users access only relevant data.
Usability:

Intuitive interface for drivers with turn-by-turn navigation.
Accessibility features for visually impaired users (e.g., voice commands).
Multilingual support for diverse user groups.
4. Constraints
Technical Constraints:

The system must run on Android and iOS devices for drivers.
Limited to cloud-based deployment using AWS services for scalability.
Compliance Requirements:

Adherence to local data protection regulations, such as GDPR and CCPA.
Compliance with traffic and delivery-related regional regulations.
Resource Constraints:

Development budget capped at $3 million.
Deployment timeline of 14 months, with key features available within the first 9 months.
Integration Needs:

Integration with third-party mapping services like Google Maps or Mapbox.
API support for e-commerce platforms to fetch delivery orders and update statuses.
This scenario provides a comprehensive framework for a last-mile logistics system, addressing critical functional and non-functional requirements while considering domain-specific constraints and challenges.
