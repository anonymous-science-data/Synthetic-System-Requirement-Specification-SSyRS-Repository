The system is designed to streamline cross-border logistics operations, focusing on customs clearance, trade compliance, and real-time visibility of international shipments. It enables efficient document handling and regulatory compliance while providing actionable insights to optimize delivery timelines.

Domain/Context:
Logistics and international freight forwarding, specifically addressing the complexities of cross-border trade for industries such as manufacturing, automotive, and retail.

Stakeholders:

Freight Forwarders: Manage international shipping logistics.
Customs Brokers: Ensure regulatory compliance for cross-border shipments.
Importers and Exporters: Track goods and ensure timely delivery.
Compliance Teams: Verify adherence to trade laws and tariffs.
End Customers: Receive updates and ensure goods are delivered without delays.
User Base Characteristics:

Size: Approximately 25,000 users across various roles.
Diversity: Multilingual users with varying technical proficiencies.
Geographic Distribution: Operates in multiple regions, including Asia, Europe, North America, and Africa.
Roles: Administrators, customs officials, logistics managers, compliance officers, and end customers.
2. Functional Requirements
Core Features:

Automated customs documentation generation based on shipment details.
Integration with trade compliance databases to validate HS codes, tariffs, and duties.
Real-time shipment tracking across international borders.
Notifications for shipment status, delays, or customs inspections.
Predictive analytics for delivery time estimates and potential bottlenecks.
Frequency of Authentication:

Per session for general users.
Per action for high-sensitivity operations like modifying customs data or overriding shipping routes.
Sensitivity of Actions:

High Sensitivity: Data modifications, tariff calculations, and shipment re-routes.
Medium Sensitivity: Viewing detailed customs compliance reports.
Low Sensitivity: Checking shipment status updates.
3. Non-Functional Requirements
Performance:

System must process up to 1,000 customs documents per minute during peak hours.
Response time for shipment tracking updates must be under 3 seconds.
Scalability:

Support up to 50,000 concurrent users during peak trade seasons.
Dynamic scaling of resources to handle unexpected spikes in demand.
Reliability:

99.95% uptime to ensure uninterrupted global operations.
Robust disaster recovery mechanisms with data backups every 10 minutes.
Security:

Compliance with ISO 27001 for information security management.
Multi-layer encryption for sensitive shipment and trade data.
Role-based access control (RBAC) for different user roles.
Usability:

User-friendly dashboard with region-specific configurations.
Support for multiple languages and currencies.
Mobile-friendly interface for field agents and customs officers.
4. Constraints
Technical Constraints:

Must integrate with third-party customs and tariff APIs (e.g., World Customs Organization).
Operates on a hybrid cloud model to meet regional data residency requirements.
Compliance Requirements:

Adherence to regional trade regulations, including GDPR, CCPA, and local customs laws.
Support for trade agreements such as NAFTA and EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement.
Resource Constraints:

Initial development budget of $5 million.
Delivery timeline of 18 months, with phased deployment for key features.
Integration Needs:

Seamless integration with ERP systems like SAP and Oracle for data exchange.
API support for third-party logistics and freight management systems.
This scenario reflects the realistic requirements for a cross-border logistics software system, addressing functional and non-functional needs while considering domain-specific challenges.
