Manufacturing Software System Scenario
1. System Overview
System Purpose:
The system is designed to enable predictive maintenance for manufacturing equipment in a high-volume production environment. It leverages IoT sensors, machine learning algorithms, and data visualization tools to identify potential equipment failures before they occur, reducing downtime and optimizing maintenance schedules.

Domain/Context:
The system operates within the automotive manufacturing sector, where unplanned equipment downtime can result in significant production delays and financial losses.

Stakeholders:

Maintenance Managers: Oversee maintenance schedules and resource allocation.
Production Supervisors: Ensure production continuity and coordinate with maintenance teams.
Plant Operators: Monitor equipment status and report anomalies.
Executives: Review cost-saving and performance metrics for operational decision-making.
IT Administrators: Maintain system infrastructure and security.
User Base Characteristics:

Approximately 250 daily active users, including maintenance teams, production staff, and management.
Users are located across two main production sites and several smaller facilities in North America and Europe.
Roles include system administrators (5%), mid-level managers (20%), and operational staff (75%).
Operational Environment:
The system is hybrid-cloud-based, with IoT data collected on-premise and analyzed in the cloud. Users access the system through desktop interfaces on-site and mobile apps in the field.

Usage Scenarios:

Predictive Alerts: Maintenance managers receive alerts when equipment shows signs of potential failure.
Maintenance Scheduling: The system automatically schedules maintenance tasks based on equipment condition and production demands.
Downtime Analysis: Supervisors review historical downtime data to identify trends and optimize production planning.
Equipment Monitoring: Plant operators use real-time dashboards to track machine performance and flag irregularities.
2. Functional Requirements
Core Features:

Real-time data collection from IoT sensors monitoring equipment performance.
Machine learning models to analyze data and predict equipment failures.
Automated scheduling for maintenance tasks, integrating with existing CMMS (Computerized Maintenance Management Systems).
Customizable dashboards and reports for monitoring and analysis.
Alerts and notifications for impending failures, maintenance due dates, or unusual equipment behavior.
Authentication Conditions & Frequency:

Users authenticate once per 8-hour shift.
High-sensitivity actions, such as adjusting machine learning model parameters or overriding automated maintenance schedules, require re-authentication.
Mobile users are required to re-authenticate every 2 hours to minimize risks from remote access.
Sensitivity of Actions & Permission Levels:

High Sensitivity: Adjusting predictive models, changing maintenance rules, or approving costly maintenance actions (restricted to administrators and managers).
Moderate Sensitivity: Viewing detailed downtime analyses and predictive alerts (accessible to managers and supervisors).
Low Sensitivity: Monitoring equipment status and logging routine maintenance tasks (available to all operational staff).
3. Non-Functional Requirements
Performance:

The system must handle data from 1,000 IoT devices simultaneously, with a latency of no more than 1 second for critical alerts.
Response times for user queries or dashboard interactions must remain under 2 seconds.
Scalability:

The system should support a 50% increase in IoT devices and users over the next five years.
Reliability:

99.9% uptime, with automated failover mechanisms and disaster recovery within 4 hours.
Security:

End-to-end encryption for data in transit and at rest.
Regular security audits to identify and address vulnerabilities.
Usability:

User interfaces must be intuitive, with role-specific views tailored to different responsibilities.
Multilingual support for English, German, and Spanish.
Audit & Monitoring:

Comprehensive logging of user actions, predictive alerts, and maintenance decisions, retained for at least three years.
Real-time monitoring of system health and security events with automated notifications.
4. Constraints
Technical Constraints:

The system must integrate with existing CMMS platforms and ERP systems.
IoT devices from multiple vendors must be supported, requiring flexible APIs and compatibility layers.
Compliance Requirements:

Adherence to ISO 55000 standards for asset management.
GDPR compliance for European facilities.
Resource Constraints:

Initial development budget of $3 million, with $600,000 annually allocated for maintenance and scaling.
Project timeline of 30 months, including a 6-month buffer for unforeseen challenges.
Integration Needs:

Seamless integration with existing authentication services and IoT device networks.
Compatibility with cloud providers already used by the organization for other systems.
