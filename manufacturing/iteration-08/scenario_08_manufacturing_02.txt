Manufacturing Software System Scenario
1. System Overview
System Purpose:
The system is designed to improve the efficiency of supply chain and logistics management in a large-scale manufacturing environment. It enables real-time tracking of raw materials and finished goods across multiple facilities, optimizes production schedules based on supply availability, and provides advanced analytics for demand forecasting.

Domain/Context:
Heavy equipment manufacturing, where timely production and delivery of components are critical to meeting customer deadlines and maintaining production throughput.

Stakeholders:

Supply Chain Managers: Oversee the procurement and movement of materials.
Production Supervisors: Adjust schedules to align with material availability.
Logistics Teams: Manage the distribution of finished goods to customers.
Executives: Monitor overall supply chain efficiency and performance metrics.
IT Administrators: Ensure system reliability and security.
User Base Characteristics:

Approximately 350 daily users, including supply chain staff, logistics teams, and management.
Users are geographically distributed across five manufacturing plants in North America and Asia.
Roles include administrators (5%), managers (25%), and operational staff (70%).
Operational Environment:
The system is fully cloud-based, leveraging an advanced data analytics platform integrated with on-premise IoT devices for real-time material tracking. Access is available through desktop interfaces at facilities and mobile apps for logistics personnel in transit.

Usage Scenarios:

Material Tracking: Supply chain managers track shipments in real-time and adjust inventory forecasts accordingly.
Production Adjustments: Supervisors modify production schedules dynamically based on updated material delivery timelines.
Demand Forecasting: Executives analyze sales trends and inventory levels to predict future material requirements.
Logistics Coordination: Logistics teams assign shipments to carriers and monitor delivery progress via GPS integration.
2. Functional Requirements
Core Features:

Integration with IoT sensors for real-time location and condition tracking of raw materials.
Automated alerts for material shortages or shipment delays.
Predictive analytics for demand forecasting based on historical and real-time data.
Dynamic production scheduling tools that respond to material availability changes.
Logistics management features, including shipment tracking and carrier coordination.
Authentication Conditions & Frequency:

Users authenticate at the start of each work shift (12-hour session expiration).
High-sensitivity actions, such as modifying production schedules or approving shipment reallocations, require re-authentication.
Mobile users are prompted to re-authenticate every 4 hours due to increased risks associated with mobile access.
Sensitivity of Actions & Permission Levels:

High Sensitivity: Adjusting production schedules, changing supplier details, or approving large-scale purchase orders (restricted to managers and executives).
Moderate Sensitivity: Viewing predictive analytics reports or shipment tracking details (accessible to managers and above).
Low Sensitivity: Logging material arrivals or updating shipment statuses (available to all operational staff).
3. Non-Functional Requirements
Performance:

The system must handle up to 1,000 concurrent users globally with response times under 2 seconds.
IoT data ingestion must occur with a latency of no more than 1 second for real-time updates.
Scalability:

Designed to support a 75% increase in facilities and user base over the next five years without performance degradation.
Reliability:

99.95% uptime requirement, with a disaster recovery strategy that ensures full data restoration within 2 hours of a critical failure.
Security:

All data transmitted between IoT devices, cloud servers, and user interfaces must be encrypted.
Role-based access controls (RBAC) and regular penetration testing must be implemented.
Usability:

Mobile and desktop interfaces must provide intuitive navigation with localization for English, Chinese, and Spanish.
Training resources and tooltips embedded within the system to assist first-time users.
Audit & Monitoring:

Detailed logs of all material movements, production changes, and shipment updates must be maintained for a minimum of five years.
Real-time monitoring and alerting for unauthorized access or unusual system activity.
4. Constraints
Technical Constraints:

The system must integrate seamlessly with the company's existing ERP platform and logistics provider APIs.
IoT devices in use must be compatible with the new system, requiring custom driver development for legacy hardware.
Compliance Requirements:

Adherence to ISO 28000 for supply chain security management.
Compliance with regional data protection regulations (e.g., GDPR for Europe, CCPA for California).
Resource Constraints:

Initial development budget of $2.5 million, with $500,000 annually for ongoing maintenance and scaling.
Project time-frame of 24 months, including a 4-month buffer for testing and contingency planning.
Integration Needs:

The system must support integration with existing authentication services and provide API hooks for third-party logistics platforms.
