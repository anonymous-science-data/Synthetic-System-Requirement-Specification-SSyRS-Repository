Manufacturing Software System Scenario
1. System Overview
System Purpose:
The system aims to optimize inventory management, production scheduling, and quality control for a mid-sized manufacturing firm specializing in precision machining. It integrates real-time data from IoT-enabled machines, warehouses, and supply chain partners to streamline operations, reduce waste, and enhance product quality.

Domain/Context:
Precision manufacturing for automotive and aerospace components, where efficiency and quality are critical to meeting stringent industry standards.

Stakeholders:

Production Managers: Oversee production schedules and machine utilization.
Inventory Managers: Monitor stock levels and coordinate with suppliers.
Quality Control Teams: Ensure products meet compliance and quality standards.
Executives: Review high-level KPIs and operational reports for strategic planning.
IT Administrators: Maintain system infrastructure and address technical issues.
User Base Characteristics:

Approximately 200 daily active users, including production floor workers, warehouse staff, and management.
Roles include system administrators (5%), mid-level managers (20%), and operational staff (75%).
Users are located across three production sites in North America and Europe, with the potential for expansion to Asia.
Operational Environment:
The system is hybrid-cloud-based, combining on-premise IoT data collection with cloud-hosted analytics and reporting. Users access the system through desktop workstations on the production floor and mobile devices in warehouses.

Usage Scenarios:

Production Monitoring: Production managers view real-time machine status and adjust schedules dynamically.
Inventory Tracking: Warehouse staff update stock levels and flag reordering needs via mobile devices.
Quality Control Alerts: The system flags deviations in product specifications, allowing quality teams to intervene early.
Supplier Coordination: Inventory managers generate and send purchase orders directly to suppliers through the system.
2. Functional Requirements
Core Features:

Real-time monitoring of machine performance and output.
Automated alerts for low inventory levels or quality deviations.
Scheduling module for production planning, including shift management.
Data visualization tools for analyzing key metrics (e.g., production efficiency, defect rates).
Integration with ERP systems for seamless order processing and supplier management.
Authentication Conditions & Frequency:

Users authenticate at the start of each shift (8-hour session expiration).
Sensitive actions, such as adjusting production schedules or approving supplier payments, require re-authentication.
Mobile users must re-authenticate every 2 hours due to increased security risks in remote access environments.
Sensitivity of Actions & Permission Levels:

High Sensitivity: Adjusting machine configurations, modifying production schedules, or overriding quality control alerts (restricted to managers and administrators).
Moderate Sensitivity: Viewing operational KPIs or supplier contact details (available to mid-level managers and above).
Low Sensitivity: Updating inventory or logging production progress (accessible to all operational staff).
3. Non-Functional Requirements
Performance:

Response times under 2 seconds for user actions, even during peak usage.
The system must process and display IoT data streams with a latency of no more than 1 second.
Scalability:

Capable of supporting up to 500 concurrent users and a 50% increase in IoT device data within five years.
Reliability:

99.9% uptime requirement, with a disaster recovery plan ensuring full data recovery within 4 hours of major outages.
Security:

Role-based access control (RBAC) and encryption for all data in transit and at rest.
Regular security audits to identify and mitigate vulnerabilities.
Usability:

Intuitive interfaces with role-specific dashboards tailored to user responsibilities.
Multilingual support for English, Spanish, and German.
Audit & Monitoring:

Logs for all system actions, including user authentications and production changes, retained for five years.
Real-time monitoring of system health and security events with automated alerts.
4. Constraints
Technical Constraints:

Must integrate with existing ERP and MES (Manufacturing Execution System) platforms.
Limited compatibility with older IoT hardware requiring specific drivers.
Compliance Requirements:

Adherence to ISO 9001 and AS9100 standards for quality management.
GDPR compliance for data handling in the European site.
Resource Constraints:

Initial development budget of $1.2 million, with $300,000 allocated annually for maintenance.
Project timeline of 18 months, including a 3-month buffer for unexpected challenges.
Integration Needs:

Seamless data exchange with existing ERP systems for order management and financial reporting.
Compatibility with the firm's supplier portal for procurement processes.
