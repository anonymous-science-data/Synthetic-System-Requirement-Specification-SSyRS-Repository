Scenario: Manufacturing Execution System (MES) Enhancement Project

1. System Overview
System Purpose:
To enhance the functionality of the existing Manufacturing Execution System (MES) to provide real-time production monitoring, advanced analytics, and improved decision-making capabilities, thereby reducing downtime and enhancing overall efficiency in production processes.

Domain/Context:
The manufacturing sector, specifically targeting medium to large-scale production facilities in the automotive and electronics industries.

Stakeholders:

Production Managers: Oversee daily operations and optimize production schedules.
Quality Assurance Teams: Ensure product quality standards are met.
Maintenance Engineers: Monitor equipment and proactively manage repairs.
IT Administrators: Manage system infrastructure and security.
Executive Leadership: Utilize high-level reports for strategic decision-making.
User Base Characteristics:

Size: Approximately 500-1,000 users across various roles.
Diversity: Includes technical (engineers, IT) and non-technical (managers, operators) users.
Geographic Distribution: Multiple production sites globally with centralized management.
Roles: Operators, engineers, managers, and executives with distinct permissions and needs.
Operational Environment:
The system will be cloud-hosted with hybrid on-premise components for localized data collection. Users will access it via web portals and mobile apps optimized for shop-floor conditions.

Usage Scenarios:

Operators update real-time machine statuses using tablets on the shop floor.
Managers receive alerts and detailed reports on production bottlenecks via dashboards.
Maintenance engineers access predictive maintenance insights based on IoT sensor data.
Executives review high-level production KPIs and drill down into analytics during strategic meetings.
2. Functional Requirements
Core Features:

Real-Time Data Collection: Integration with IoT sensors to capture production metrics.
Advanced Reporting and Dashboards: Customizable analytics for different roles.
Predictive Maintenance Alerts: AI-driven insights into potential equipment failures.
Work Order Management: Automated assignment and tracking of production tasks.
Quality Control Monitoring: Real-time alerts for defects or deviations in process parameters.
Authentication Conditions & Frequency:

Frequency: Single sign-on (SSO) with session persistence for 8 hours.
Conditions: Reauthentication required for sensitive actions such as system configuration changes.
Sensitivity of Actions & Permission Levels:

Operators can update status but cannot access analytics.
Managers can view analytics and assign tasks but cannot alter system configurations.
IT Administrators have full system control, including user and system management.
3. Non-Functional Requirements
Performance:

Sub-second response times for critical shop-floor updates.
Dashboards must handle up to 100 concurrent users without noticeable latency.
Scalability:

Support for a 50% increase in production lines and users over five years.
Capability to process up to 10 million IoT sensor data points per day.
Reliability:

99.9% uptime with failover mechanisms in case of hardware or network failures.
Automatic data recovery within 5 minutes in the event of disruptions.
Security:

Multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all administrative roles.
End-to-end encryption of data both in transit and at rest.
Role-based access control with audit trails.
Usability:

User interfaces tailored to technical and non-technical roles.
Mobile-friendly design for seamless access on tablets and smartphones.
In-app help and training guides for new users.
Audit & Monitoring:

Real-time logging of all user activities.
Scheduled reports on system usage and anomalies.
Alerts for unauthorized access attempts.
4. Constraints
Technical Constraints:

Must operate seamlessly with existing IoT and ERP systems.
Limited on-premise server capacity necessitating efficient data handling.
Compliance Requirements:

Adherence to ISO 9001 quality management standards.
Compliance with GDPR for user data protection.
Resource Constraints:

Project budget capped at $2 million.
Development timeline of 12 months with a team of 10 engineers.
Integration Needs:

Must integrate with SAP ERP for production planning and resource management.
Compatibility with existing IoT hardware from multiple vendors.
This scenario captures realistic challenges and solutions for manufacturing software systems, ensuring coherence and industry alignment.
