Scenario: Predictive Maintenance and Workflow Optimization System

1. System Overview
System Purpose:
To implement a predictive maintenance and workflow optimization system that reduces unplanned downtime, improves equipment efficiency, and optimizes production workflows. The system leverages IoT sensors, machine learning, and advanced analytics to predict equipment failures and streamline maintenance processes.

Domain/Context:
Manufacturing sector focused on heavy machinery and equipment production, where downtime has significant financial and operational impacts.

Stakeholders:

Maintenance Managers: Plan and prioritize maintenance schedules.
Machine Operators: Monitor equipment health and perform first-level diagnostics.
Production Supervisors: Ensure maintenance activities align with production targets.
Data Analysts: Use predictive insights to refine processes and reduce costs.
IT Teams: Maintain infrastructure and security for the system.
User Base Characteristics:

Size: Approximately 400-600 users across multiple roles and locations.
Diversity: Users include technical personnel (engineers, IT) and operational staff (operators, supervisors).
Geographic Distribution: Multiple production sites in North America, Europe, and Asia, with centralized data processing.
Roles: Operators access equipment dashboards; managers oversee maintenance schedules; analysts work with predictive data models.
Operational Environment:
The system will be hosted on a hybrid cloud infrastructure with localized data processing using edge devices to minimize latency for real-time monitoring. Users access the system through desktop interfaces, tablets, and mobile apps.

Usage Scenarios:

Operators receive real-time alerts about potential equipment issues and initiate diagnostics using tablets.
Maintenance managers adjust schedules based on predictive insights and oversee repair activities.
Production supervisors monitor downtime impacts and reallocate resources in real-time.
IT teams analyze logs and ensure compliance with security protocols.
2. Functional Requirements
Core Features:

IoT Sensor Integration: Collect data on vibration, temperature, and usage from machines.
Predictive Analytics: Use machine learning models to identify potential equipment failures.
Maintenance Scheduling: Automate scheduling based on predicted failures and operational priorities.
Workflow Management: Track ongoing repairs and adjust production workflows dynamically.
Dashboard and Reporting: Provide role-specific dashboards with key metrics and predictive insights.
Authentication Conditions & Frequency:

Frequency: Single sign-on (SSO) with session expiration after 8 hours of inactivity.
Conditions: Reauthentication required for sensitive actions such as overriding predictive recommendations or accessing raw data models.
Sensitivity of Actions & Permission Levels:

Operators can view and respond to alerts but cannot modify predictive models.
Maintenance managers can update schedules and approve maintenance overrides.
IT administrators manage user roles, system configurations, and raw data access.
3. Non-Functional Requirements
Performance:

Predictive alerts must be generated within 2 seconds of anomaly detection.
The system should support up to 200 concurrent users with no degradation in performance.
Scalability:

The system should handle up to 10,000 connected machines and 5 years of historical data for machine learning models.
Support a 40% increase in user base and data volume over the next three years.
Reliability:

Ensure 99.95% uptime with automated failover systems.
Recovery mechanisms should restore full system functionality within 5 minutes of an outage.
Security:

Multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all users accessing sensitive data.
End-to-end encryption for IoT data and user interactions.
Role-based access control with logging for all privileged actions.
Usability:

Mobile-friendly interfaces for shop-floor staff.
Simplified onboarding process with in-app tutorials and guided workflows.
Localization support for multiple languages to accommodate global users.
Audit & Monitoring:

Log all user actions, system changes, and predictive model updates.
Provide monthly compliance reports and anomaly detection logs.
Automated notifications for unauthorized access attempts or unusual system activity.
4. Constraints
Technical Constraints:

IoT sensors must be compatible with existing equipment and infrastructure.
Edge devices must support local processing and seamless integration with the cloud.
Compliance Requirements:

Adherence to ISO 55001 standards for asset management.
Compliance with GDPR for data privacy and protection across European facilities.
Resource Constraints:

Budget capped at $5 million, with a 16-month timeline for full implementation.
Development team of 15, supported by external consultants for IoT hardware integration.
Integration Needs:

Must integrate with existing ERP systems for resource planning and MES for production workflows.
APIs for future extensions into quality control and supply chain modules.
This scenario addresses industry-specific needs for predictive maintenance and workflow optimization while ensuring feasibility and alignment with manufacturing challenges.
