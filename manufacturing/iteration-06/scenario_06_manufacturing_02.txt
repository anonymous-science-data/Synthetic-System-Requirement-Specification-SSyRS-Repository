Manufacturing System Requirements Scenario
1. System Overview
System Purpose:
The system, named "Shopfloor Sync," is designed to centralize production scheduling, provide live status updates on manufacturing processes, and enable automated quality control checks through integration with IoT-enabled machinery. Its primary objective is to improve operational efficiency, reduce waste, and ensure consistent product quality.

Domain/Context:
The system operates within the automotive manufacturing sector, where precise assembly line coordination and stringent quality standards are critical for success.

Stakeholders:

Production Managers: Oversee scheduling, resource allocation, and production targets.
Quality Assurance Teams: Monitor automated quality control and validate flagged anomalies.
Line Operators: Receive task assignments and monitor machine performance.
IT Administrators: Manage system maintenance, updates, and data integrity.
User Base Characteristics:

Approximately 1,000 users across three regional production facilities in North America.
Users include operators, managers, and IT staff, with varying technical expertise.
Heavy reliance on the system by frontline staff for daily operations.
Operational Environment:

Hosted as a cloud-based solution with local servers at each facility for real-time processing.
Accessible via fixed workstations on the shop floor and portable tablets for managers and quality control teams.
Usage Scenarios:

A production manager updates the daily production schedule and assigns machine priorities based on incoming order demand.
Operators log in to their workstation terminals to view specific assembly tasks and equipment availability.
Quality assurance staff receives automated notifications when sensors detect an anomaly in component dimensions, prompting a manual inspection.
IT staff monitors system health and addresses any data synchronization issues between local servers and the cloud.
2. Functional Requirements
Core Features:

Production Scheduling Module: Dynamic scheduling tools for balancing workloads across multiple shifts and lines.
Real-Time Monitoring: Integration with IoT sensors for live updates on machine and product status.
Automated Quality Checks: Analyze sensor data to detect deviations from specifications.
Alerting System: Notify users of potential issues, such as machine downtime or defective outputs.
Role-Specific Dashboards: Customized views for operators, managers, and IT staff.
Authentication Conditions & Frequency:

Users authenticate at the beginning of each shift or after 15 minutes of inactivity.
Re-authentication is required when accessing sensitive modules, such as editing production schedules or overriding quality flags.
Sensitivity of Actions & Permission Levels:

High Sensitivity: Adjusting production targets or schedules (Production Managers).
Medium Sensitivity: Approving flagged quality anomalies (Quality Assurance Teams).
Low Sensitivity: Viewing task assignments (Operators).
Access permissions are strictly role-based and logged for auditing purposes.
3. Non-Functional Requirements
Performance:

System must process sensor data with a latency of no more than 3 seconds for local operations.
Able to support 150 concurrent users per facility without noticeable slowdowns.
Scalability:

Capable of scaling to include two additional facilities and a 50% increase in users over five years.
Reliability:

99.95% uptime required, with automated failover mechanisms to ensure continuity during server issues.
Backup and recovery processes must ensure no more than 5 minutes of data loss in the event of a failure.
Security:

Strict access controls and end-to-end encryption for data in transit and at rest.
Regular vulnerability scans and patch updates.
Usability:

Interface designed for minimal training with intuitive navigation and interactive tutorials.
Multi-language support for English and Spanish to accommodate the workforce.
Audit & Monitoring:

Detailed logging of user actions, including schedule changes, flagged quality checks, and login attempts.
Audit logs must be retained for 7 years to comply with automotive manufacturing standards.
4. Constraints
Technical Constraints:

The system must integrate with existing PLC (Programmable Logic Controller) networks on the shop floor.
Limited bandwidth between facilities requires efficient data synchronization protocols.
Compliance Requirements:

Must adhere to ISO/TS 16949 standards for automotive quality management.
Data handling must comply with regional data protection laws, including CCPA in California.
Resource Constraints:

Development budget is capped at $2 million, with a deployment timeframe of 18 months.
Integration Needs:

Seamless connectivity with the company's existing ERP system for order tracking and inventory management.
APIs required to integrate with third-party analytics tools for production insights.
