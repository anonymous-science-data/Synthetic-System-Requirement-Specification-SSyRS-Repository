Manufacturing System Requirements Scenario
1. System Overview
System Purpose:
The system, named "FactoryFlow," is designed to enhance production efficiency and accuracy in mid-size manufacturing plants by automating scheduling, monitoring workflows, and providing analytics for resource optimization. Its goal is to minimize downtime, improve throughput, and reduce manual intervention in operations.

Domain/Context:
The system is tailored for the precision machining industry, where maintaining tight tolerances and ensuring timely production are critical to meet client specifications and deadlines.

Stakeholders:

Production Supervisors: Oversee schedules, manage production targets, and address bottlenecks.
Machine Operators: Use the system to view task assignments and input operational data.
Quality Inspectors: Verify product dimensions and respond to flagged quality issues.
IT Administrators: Manage system performance, updates, and integration with other platforms.
User Base Characteristics:

Approximately 300 users across two manufacturing facilities located in the U.S.
Includes production staff, quality control teams, and administrative personnel.
A diverse user base with varying levels of technical proficiency.
Operational Environment:

Cloud-hosted solution with edge computing nodes deployed at each facility for low-latency local operations.
Accessible via fixed terminals on the shop floor, tablets for mobility, and desktop systems in administrative offices.
Usage Scenarios:

A production supervisor creates and adjusts the daily production schedule based on incoming orders and available resources.
Operators log into their terminal to view machine-specific tasks and update progress.
Quality inspectors receive automated alerts to review flagged components failing dimensional checks.
IT administrators ensure synchronization between edge devices and the cloud platform while monitoring system health.
2. Functional Requirements
Core Features:

Dynamic Scheduling: Allow supervisors to adjust schedules in real-time based on changing priorities or delays.
Workflow Monitoring: Track the progress of jobs through each stage of production.
Quality Control Integration: Automate inspections and flag deviations using integrated IoT sensors.
Resource Utilization Dashboard: Provide analytics on machine usage, operator efficiency, and production throughput.
Issue Notification System: Alert users to potential delays, machine failures, or quality concerns.
Authentication Conditions & Frequency:

Users authenticate once per shift or after 30 minutes of inactivity.
Re-authentication is required for sensitive actions, such as modifying schedules or overriding flagged quality checks.
Sensitivity of Actions & Permission Levels:

High Sensitivity: Editing production schedules (Supervisors), overriding flagged quality issues (Quality Inspectors).
Medium Sensitivity: Submitting machine status reports (Operators).
Low Sensitivity: Viewing dashboards and task progress (General Staff).
Access is restricted based on roles, with detailed logging of all sensitive actions.
3. Non-Functional Requirements
Performance:

Local operations must process updates with a latency of no more than 5 seconds.
The system supports 50 concurrent users per facility without performance degradation.
Scalability:

The system must accommodate a 30% increase in production volume and user base over the next five years.
Reliability:

Uptime of 99.9% with failover mechanisms to ensure continuous operation during server outages.
Backup mechanisms to ensure no more than 10 minutes of data loss in the event of a failure.
Security:

Data must be encrypted in transit and at rest.
Regular vulnerability assessments and proactive patching to maintain security integrity.
Usability:

The interface must be intuitive, with role-specific customization to minimize training requirements.
Support for English and Spanish for operators in the U.S.
Audit & Monitoring:

All user activities, including login events and modifications to schedules or quality overrides, must be logged.
Logs must be retained for 5 years to comply with industry standards.
4. Constraints
Technical Constraints:

The system must integrate with existing legacy ERP and MES platforms.
Limited network bandwidth between facilities requires efficient data compression and synchronization mechanisms.
Compliance Requirements:

The system must adhere to AS9100 standards for quality management in the precision machining industry.
Data handling must comply with GDPR for any European clients serviced by the facilities.
Resource Constraints:

The project has a budget of $1.8 million and a 15-month timeline for initial implementation.
Integration Needs:

Seamless integration with IoT sensors and machine controllers to enable real-time data capture.
API support for third-party analytics tools used by management to evaluate production trends.
