Manufacturing System Requirements Scenario
1. System Overview
System Purpose:
The system, named "Production Optimizer," aims to streamline and enhance manufacturing operations by providing real-time tracking of production workflows, predictive maintenance scheduling, and integrated inventory management. It reduces downtime and optimizes resource utilization across multiple facilities.

Domain/Context:
The system operates within the discrete manufacturing sector, focusing on companies that produce industrial equipment and machinery. These organizations typically have complex production lines with interdependent processes.

Stakeholders:

Operations Managers: Monitor production efficiency and address bottlenecks.
Maintenance Teams: Use predictive alerts to reduce unexpected equipment failures.
Inventory Managers: Ensure raw materials and components are available to meet production schedules.
C-Suite Executives: Evaluate operational KPIs and ROI metrics to guide strategic decisions.
User Base Characteristics:

Approximately 500 users spread across five manufacturing plants globally.
Roles include machine operators, maintenance staff, inventory planners, and administrators.
Users vary in technical proficiency, requiring a user-friendly interface.
Geographic distribution includes facilities in North America, Europe, and Asia.
Operational Environment:

Hosted as a hybrid system: cloud-based for central coordination and analytics, with edge computing at manufacturing sites for low-latency operational support.
Accessible via desktop terminals on production floors and mobile devices for managers on the move.
Usage Scenarios:

A machine operator logs into the system at the start of their shift to view assigned tasks and machine performance data.
The maintenance team receives automated alerts when sensor data indicates an imminent equipment failure.
Inventory planners monitor stock levels and generate replenishment orders based on current production schedules.
Executives review system-generated reports on operational efficiency and cost savings.
2. Functional Requirements
Core Features:

Production Monitoring: Track real-time machine performance and task progress.
Predictive Maintenance: Analyze sensor data to forecast failures and schedule repairs.
Inventory Management: Automate stock level tracking and order generation.
Role-Based Dashboards: Provide tailored views for different user roles (e.g., operators, managers).
Data Visualization: Generate graphical reports on key metrics like uptime and production throughput.
Authentication Conditions & Frequency:

Users authenticate at the start of each shift or when accessing the system after being inactive for 30 minutes.
Re-authentication is required for sensitive actions, such as approving maintenance schedules or modifying inventory reorder thresholds.
Sensitivity of Actions & Permission Levels:

High Sensitivity: Approving production schedule changes (Operations Managers).
Medium Sensitivity: Updating machine maintenance logs (Maintenance Staff).
Low Sensitivity: Viewing performance dashboards (General Staff).
Permissions are role-based, with fine-grained access controls.
3. Non-Functional Requirements
Performance:

Real-time data updates with a maximum latency of 2 seconds.
System supports concurrent access by up to 100 users per facility without performance degradation.
Scalability:

Must handle a 50% increase in data inputs and users over the next three years.
Reliability:

99.9% uptime, with automatic failover capabilities in case of hardware or network failures.
Comprehensive error logging and recovery mechanisms.
Security:

End-to-end encryption for data in transit and at rest.
Regular penetration testing to identify and mitigate vulnerabilities.
Usability:

Intuitive interface designed for minimal training, with tooltips and context-sensitive help.
Supports multi-language localization for global facilities.
Audit & Monitoring:

Logs all user actions, including login times, data changes, and sensitive approvals.
Audit logs must be immutable and accessible for 5 years for compliance purposes.
4. Constraints
Technical Constraints:

Must run on existing edge computing devices at facilities, which have limited storage and processing power.
Backend must integrate with legacy MES (Manufacturing Execution System) software.
Compliance Requirements:

Adherence to ISO 9001 (Quality Management) and ISO 27001 (Information Security) standards.
Compliance with GDPR for data handling in European facilities.
Resource Constraints:

Development budget is capped at $1.5 million.
Initial deployment must be completed within 12 months.
Integration Needs:

Seamless integration with the organization's ERP system for financial and supply chain data exchange.
APIs must be provided to connect with third-party IoT devices for sensor data.
