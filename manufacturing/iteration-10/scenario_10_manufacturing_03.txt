1. System Overview

System Purpose:
To design and deploy an Energy Optimization and Resource Management System (EORMS) to monitor and reduce energy consumption, optimize resource allocation, and lower operational costs in energy-intensive manufacturing processes.

Domain/Context:
This system is focused on the chemical manufacturing industry, where production plants operate around the clock and consume significant energy for heating, cooling, and chemical processing.

Stakeholders:

    Plant Managers: Oversee energy usage and production performance.
    Maintenance Teams: Monitor and maintain energy-intensive equipment.
    Energy Analysts: Analyze energy consumption patterns and identify optimization opportunities.
    Executive Leadership: Monitor long-term sustainability goals and cost efficiency.
    Regulatory Auditors: Validate compliance with energy usage and environmental regulations.

User Base Characteristics:

    Size: Approximately 200 users.
    Diversity: Includes on-site operations staff, energy specialists, and corporate executives.
    Geographic Distribution: Plants are located in the United States, Germany, and South Africa, with a central office for energy analysis in the United Kingdom.
    Roles: Key roles include operators, maintenance engineers, energy analysts, and executives.

Operational Environment:

    Hosting: Cloud-based analytics engine with edge devices installed at each manufacturing plant for real-time energy monitoring and control.
    Access Methods: Web-based dashboards for centralized reporting and mobile apps for plant-floor staff.

Usage Scenarios:

    Plant managers use dashboards to monitor energy usage in real time and receive alerts about anomalies or excessive consumption.
    Maintenance teams receive predictive maintenance notifications for energy-intensive equipment.
    Energy analysts generate monthly reports on energy consumption patterns and recommend adjustments.
    Executives review sustainability metrics and monitor progress toward energy efficiency targets.

2. Functional Requirements

Core Features:

    Real-time monitoring of energy usage across all production units.
    Predictive analytics for optimizing equipment operation schedules and reducing downtime.
    Automated recommendations for reducing peak energy loads during high-demand periods.
    Configurable dashboards for energy reporting and sustainability metrics.
    Integration with existing SCADA systems to track equipment performance and resource consumption.
    Centralized storage of historical energy data for trend analysis and compliance reporting.

Authentication Conditions & Frequency:

    Authentication is required once per session, with automatic logout after 12 hours of inactivity.
    Reauthentication is triggered when users access sensitive actions, such as modifying optimization parameters or exporting compliance reports.

Sensitivity of Actions & Permission Levels:

    High Sensitivity: Approving energy allocation changes or submitting compliance reports (restricted to plant managers and executives).
    Medium Sensitivity: Analyzing energy trends and recommending operational changes (restricted to energy analysts).
    Low Sensitivity: Viewing dashboards and logging maintenance updates (accessible to operators and maintenance staff).

3. Non-Functional Requirements

Performance:

    Dashboards must update with real-time data within 2 seconds.
    Predictive analytics must generate optimization recommendations within 5 seconds of detecting high energy loads.

Scalability:

    The system must support the addition of up to five new plants within the next five years without degradation in performance.
    Scalable storage to accommodate a 10-year archive of energy consumption data.

Reliability:

    99.9% uptime for cloud-based components, with automatic failover for critical monitoring functions at the edge.
    Backup and recovery systems must ensure no more than 5 minutes of data loss.

Security:

    End-to-end encryption for data transfers and storage, including historical energy data and operational parameters.
    Role-based access control (RBAC) to ensure appropriate access for all user roles.
    Periodic security audits to detect vulnerabilities.

Usability:

    Interfaces must support multilingual capabilities (English, German, Zulu).
    Mobile apps must be optimized for low-bandwidth environments to support remote operations.

Audit & Monitoring:

    Detailed logs of all user actions, including changes to energy allocation and parameter adjustments.
    Automated alerts for unusual user behavior or unauthorized attempts to access sensitive functions.

4. Constraints

Technical Constraints:

    Integration with legacy SCADA systems and IoT-enabled equipment at each plant is required.
    Limited network bandwidth in some plant locations requires efficient data compression and edge processing capabilities.

Compliance Requirements:

    Adherence to ISO 50001 (Energy Management Systems) and local environmental regulations in each country.
    Retention of energy consumption data for at least 7 years for regulatory audits.

Resource Constraints:

    Budget of $2.8 million for development, deployment, and initial support.
    A project timeline of 18 months, with a dedicated team of 20 professionals, including software developers, energy analysts, and project managers.

Integration Needs:

    Seamless integration with existing SCADA systems for real-time data acquisition.
    API-based interfaces for connecting with third-party energy analysis tools and sustainability reporting platforms.
