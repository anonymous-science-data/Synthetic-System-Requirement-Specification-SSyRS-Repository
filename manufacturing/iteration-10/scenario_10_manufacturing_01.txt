1. System Overview

System Purpose:
To design and implement a Production Efficiency Monitoring and Optimization System (PEMOS) aimed at improving the operational efficiency, downtime reduction, and real-time monitoring of automated and semi-automated manufacturing lines.

Domain/Context:
The system operates within the discrete manufacturing industry, focusing on mid-sized electronics component manufacturers. These manufacturers face challenges such as frequent downtime due to equipment failure, inefficient energy usage, and a lack of visibility into real-time production metrics.

Stakeholders:

    Plant Managers: Responsible for overseeing production lines and ensuring smooth operations.
    Maintenance Teams: Require predictive insights to reduce machine downtime.
    Process Engineers: Analyze process data to identify inefficiencies and optimize workflows.
    IT and Operations Teams: Ensure the system is integrated and functioning reliably.
    Regulatory Auditors: Review operational data for compliance with manufacturing standards.

User Base Characteristics:

    Size: Approximately 300 users.
    Diversity: Users include on-site employees (plant managers, operators, and maintenance staff) and remote users (executive teams, regulatory auditors).
    Geographic Distribution: Users are distributed across three manufacturing plants located in Germany, Singapore, and Mexico, with centralized IT support in the United States.
    Roles: Distinct roles include data input and monitoring by operators, advanced analytics by process engineers, and approval workflows by management teams.

Operational Environment:

    Hosting: The system is cloud-based, leveraging a hybrid cloud architecture for data storage and processing with edge computing components deployed at each plant for real-time data aggregation and processing.
    Access Methods: Users access the system via web portals, mobile applications, and dedicated dashboards on shop-floor terminals.

Usage Scenarios:

    Plant managers monitor real-time production metrics and downtime incidents using dashboards.
    Maintenance teams receive predictive alerts for equipment that requires service, allowing preventive action.
    Process engineers analyze data trends and create reports for management to optimize resource usage and reduce waste.
    Auditors review compliance-related operational logs for adherence to ISO standards.

2. Functional Requirements

Core Features:

    Real-time monitoring of production line metrics (e.g., throughput, energy usage, and machine health).
    Predictive maintenance alerts based on IoT sensor data and historical performance trends.
    Integration of edge devices for on-site data aggregation and low-latency processing.
    Advanced analytics capabilities, including trend analysis and optimization recommendations.
    Configurable role-based dashboards for users (e.g., process engineers, plant managers).
    Automated compliance reporting to meet ISO and regional manufacturing standards.

Authentication Conditions & Frequency:

    Users authenticate once per session, with automatic logout after 12 hours of inactivity.
    Authentication is required for accessing sensitive actions, such as approving resource allocation changes or exporting compliance reports.

Sensitivity of Actions & Permission Levels:

    High Sensitivity: Approving production process changes, exporting compliance reports (restricted to managers and auditors).
    Medium Sensitivity: Viewing predictive maintenance insights and analytics (restricted to process engineers and managers).
    Low Sensitivity: Monitoring dashboards and logging maintenance updates (accessible to operators and maintenance staff).

3. Non-Functional Requirements

Performance:

    Real-time dashboards must update within 2 seconds.
    Predictive maintenance alerts must be generated within 5 seconds of detecting anomalies.

Scalability:

    The system must support a 50% increase in user base or data volume without performance degradation.
    Scalable storage to accommodate 10 years of production and compliance data.

Reliability:

    99.9% uptime for cloud-based components.
    Automatic failover mechanisms for edge devices to maintain real-time monitoring during network outages.

Security:

    End-to-end data encryption (both in transit and at rest).
    Role-based access control (RBAC) to limit access to sensitive data and actions.
    Continuous vulnerability assessments to ensure system integrity.

Usability:

    Dashboards and interfaces designed with multilingual support (English, German, Spanish).
    Mobile application optimized for low-bandwidth environments to support on-site teams.

Audit & Monitoring:

    Comprehensive logging of user activities, including access to sensitive features and data exports.
    Real-time alerts for unusual user behavior, such as attempts to access restricted features.

4. Constraints

Technical Constraints:

    The system must integrate with existing SCADA systems and IoT sensors deployed across the plants.
    Limited bandwidth at some manufacturing plants requires efficient data compression and edge processing.

Compliance Requirements:

    Adherence to ISO 9001:2015 for quality management systems.
    Compliance with regional data protection regulations, such as GDPR (EU) and PDPA (Singapore).

Resource Constraints:

    Budget of $2.5 million for development, deployment, and initial operations.
    Project timeline of 18 months, including a 3-month buffer for unforeseen delays.
    A cross-functional team of 25 members, including developers, domain experts, and project managers.

Integration Needs:

    Seamless data flow between the PEMOS system, existing ERP systems (e.g., SAP), and MES platforms.
    API-based integration with third-party analytics tools for advanced modeling and simulation.
