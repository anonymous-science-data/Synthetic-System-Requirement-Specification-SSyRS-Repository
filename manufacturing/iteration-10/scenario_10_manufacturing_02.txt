1. System Overview

System Purpose:
To develop a Quality Assurance and Traceability Management System (QATMS) that enhances product quality, ensures end-to-end traceability of raw materials, components, and finished goods, and streamlines defect detection and root-cause analysis in a multi-tiered manufacturing environment.

Domain/Context:
The system is tailored for the automotive components manufacturing sector, which demands stringent quality control and traceability to comply with industry standards such as IATF 16949.

Stakeholders:

    Quality Assurance Teams: Monitor product quality and investigate defects.
    Production Managers: Track and resolve production-related quality issues.
    Suppliers: Provide traceability data for raw materials and components.
    Regulatory Auditors: Ensure compliance with industry and safety standards.
    IT Teams: Oversee system operations and maintain infrastructure.

User Base Characteristics:

    Size: Approximately 500 users across the supply chain.
    Diversity: Includes on-site factory staff, remote suppliers, and regional auditors.
    Geographic Distribution: Factories in the United States, India, and Brazil, with suppliers distributed across North America and Asia.
    Roles: Users include QA inspectors, production supervisors, supply chain managers, and compliance officers.

Operational Environment:

    Hosting: Hybrid deployment with cloud-based analytics and on-premise servers at factories to handle sensitive production data and ensure continuity during network disruptions.
    Access Methods: Web and mobile applications for users, integrated with shop-floor devices such as barcode scanners and RFID readers for data capture.

Usage Scenarios:

    QA inspectors use the system to log defects and track their resolution.
    Production managers analyze trends in defect occurrences and initiate corrective actions.
    Suppliers provide raw material and batch data via a secure portal, enabling complete traceability.
    Auditors review reports on material sourcing, production processes, and quality incidents for compliance validation.

2. Functional Requirements

Core Features:

    End-to-end traceability of materials, components, and finished goods, including batch tracking and genealogy.
    Automated defect logging and alerting using IoT-enabled devices (e.g., cameras, sensors) integrated with production lines.
    Root-cause analysis tools, including defect pattern identification and linkage to specific batches or processes.
    Configurable dashboards for tracking quality metrics (e.g., defect rate, supplier performance).
    Role-based workflows for defect review, corrective action approval, and reporting.
    Compliance reporting for IATF 16949 and regional safety standards.

Authentication Conditions & Frequency:

    Session-based authentication with automatic logout after 8 hours of inactivity.
    Reauthentication required for performing sensitive tasks, such as modifying production line parameters or exporting compliance reports.

Sensitivity of Actions & Permission Levels:

    High Sensitivity: Modifying traceability data or approving corrective actions (restricted to QA managers and compliance officers).
    Medium Sensitivity: Accessing supplier traceability data and production quality trends (restricted to production managers).
    Low Sensitivity: Logging defects and reviewing dashboards (available to QA inspectors and supervisors).

3. Non-Functional Requirements

Performance:

    Traceability queries must return results within 3 seconds for up to 1 million records.
    Real-time defect detection and alerting must occur within 2 seconds of an issue being identified.

Scalability:

    The system must support a 100% increase in the number of tracked batches and users within 3 years.
    Scalable architecture to handle additional IoT devices and data sources as new production lines are added.

Reliability:

    99.95% uptime for cloud components and failover mechanisms for on-premise servers.
    Automated backup and disaster recovery processes, ensuring no data loss beyond 5 minutes.

Security:

    End-to-end encryption for all data transfers, especially traceability and defect data.
    Role-based access control (RBAC) to ensure users access only relevant data and functions.
    Security audits conducted biannually to identify vulnerabilities.

Usability:

    Multilingual interface support (English, Portuguese, Hindi) to accommodate global users.
    Accessible design for mobile devices to enable seamless use by on-site staff.

Audit & Monitoring:

    Detailed logs of traceability updates, defect resolutions, and compliance report exports.
    Alerts for unusual activities, such as attempts to modify batch records without proper authorization.

4. Constraints

Technical Constraints:

    Integration required with existing ERP (e.g., SAP), MES, and IoT systems for defect data collection and traceability management.
    RFID and barcode reader compatibility must adhere to current hardware standards.

Compliance Requirements:

    Must comply with IATF 16949, ISO 9001, and regional data protection regulations (e.g., GDPR, LGPD in Brazil).
    Retention of traceability records for at least 10 years, as mandated by industry standards.

Resource Constraints:

    Budget of $3.8 million, including software development, hardware upgrades, and integration efforts.
    A project timeline of 24 months, with a dedicated team of 35 professionals, including developers, QA engineers, and domain experts.

Integration Needs:

    APIs for seamless integration with supplier traceability systems.
    Real-time synchronization with IoT-enabled defect detection devices on production lines.
