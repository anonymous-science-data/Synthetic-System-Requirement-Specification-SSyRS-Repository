Manufacturing Software System Scenario
1. System Overview
System Purpose:
The system, referred to as ManufactureFlow, aims to streamline and enhance the efficiency of production processes within medium-to-large manufacturing plants. Its primary objectives are to provide real-time production monitoring, enable predictive maintenance of machinery, and optimize inventory management to reduce downtime and operational costs.

Domain/Context:
The system operates within the manufacturing sector, focusing on discrete manufacturing processes such as automotive, electronics, and machinery production. It addresses challenges like production bottlenecks, equipment failure, and inefficient resource allocation.

Stakeholders:

Plant Managers: Oversee production efficiency and resolve operational issues.
Maintenance Teams: Perform machinery repairs and preventive maintenance.
Inventory Managers: Track and manage raw materials and finished goods.
Production Line Workers: Use the system to report anomalies or flag maintenance needs.
IT Teams: Manage system integrations and ensure uptime.
User Base Characteristics:

Size: 200-500 users per plant, scalable for multi-plant operations.
Diversity: Includes workers with varying technical expertise, from shop floor workers to IT professionals.
Geographic Distribution: Designed for a single country deployment initially, with potential for international expansion.
Roles: Distinct roles include Administrators, Supervisors, Maintenance Operators, and General Users.
Operational Environment:
ManufactureFlow is hosted on a hybrid cloud platform, enabling real-time data collection from IoT-enabled machinery on the shop floor and providing dashboards accessible via web and mobile applications.

Usage Scenarios:

Monitoring production line metrics (e.g., cycle times, defect rates).
Scheduling and tracking preventive maintenance tasks.
Generating alerts for inventory shortages or equipment failures.
Providing production reports and analytics to decision-makers.
2. Functional Requirements
Core Features:

Real-Time Monitoring: Display live data from IoT sensors attached to production equipment.
Predictive Maintenance: Leverage machine learning to predict equipment failures and recommend preventive actions.
Inventory Management: Track raw material levels and automatically reorder supplies based on predefined thresholds.
Reporting and Analytics: Generate performance and operational efficiency reports.
Role-Based Dashboards: Tailored views for different user roles (e.g., maintenance tasks for technicians, KPIs for managers).
Authentication Conditions & Frequency:

Users authenticate at the start of their shift (session-based authentication).
Re-authentication required for sensitive actions such as modifying maintenance schedules or accessing inventory order details.
Sessions expire after 8 hours or 30 minutes of inactivity.
Sensitivity of Actions & Permission Levels:

High Sensitivity: Adjusting system configurations or generating audit reports (Administrator role).
Medium Sensitivity: Scheduling maintenance tasks or modifying inventory thresholds (Supervisors).
Low Sensitivity: Viewing production metrics and reporting anomalies (General Users).
3. Non-Functional Requirements
Performance:

System response time should be under 2 seconds for 90% of operations.
Capable of processing data from up to 1,000 IoT devices simultaneously.
Scalability:

Must support a 30% increase in IoT devices or users without performance degradation.
Database and infrastructure should accommodate data storage growth for up to 5 years of operations.
Reliability:

99.9% uptime during operational hours (24/7).
Automatic failover mechanisms in case of server or network failures.
Security:

Data encryption in transit and at rest.
Role-based access control with logging of all sensitive actions.
Automatic account lockout after 5 failed login attempts.
Usability:

Intuitive, user-friendly interfaces for all roles, with minimal training required (max 2 days).
Multilingual support for regions with diverse workforces.
Audit & Monitoring:

Log all user actions involving inventory, maintenance schedules, or system configuration changes.
Provide audit trails accessible to authorized administrators.
4. Constraints
Technical Constraints:

IoT devices must support standard communication protocols like MQTT or OPC UA.
System must be compatible with existing ERP systems used in the plant.
Compliance Requirements:

Adhere to ISO 27001 standards for information security.
Ensure compliance with regional labor laws regarding worker data privacy.
Resource Constraints:

Budget: $2 million for initial development and deployment.
Time: 18 months, including 3 months for user acceptance testing.
Team: 20 members, including developers, testers, data scientists, and project managers.
Integration Needs:

Seamless integration with the existing MES (Manufacturing Execution System) and ERP platforms like SAP or Oracle.
APIs to connect with third-party analytics tools for advanced reporting.
This realistic scenario ensures the alignment of resources with the system's objectives and constraints, providing a robust and scalable solution for manufacturing challenges.
