Low sensitivity: Viewing account balance and basic transaction details.
3. Non-Functional Requirements
Performance:

The system must handle a transaction volume of up to 1 million concurrent users during peak hours.
Response time for transactions should not exceed 3 seconds.
Scalability:

The system should be designed to scale seamlessly to handle a 30% annual increase in user base and transaction volume without degradation in performance.
Reliability:

The system must ensure 99.99% uptime, with fault tolerance and redundancy mechanisms in place.
Automatic failover and recovery systems must be implemented to ensure uninterrupted service.
Security:

End-to-end encryption for all financial transactions and sensitive data.
Role-based access control to restrict user privileges based on roles (e.g., customers, advisors, admin).
Regular security audits and vulnerability assessments.
Biometric authentication (e.g., fingerprint or face recognition) for high-sensitivity transactions.
Usability:

Accessibility features for users with disabilities (e.g., screen readers, color contrast options).
Multi-language support to cater to a global user base.
Intuitive tools for financial planning and decision-making, with minimal user input required.
4. Constraints
Technical Constraints:

Legacy systems must be integrated with the new platform, which may limit some functionality or require additional resources for compatibility.

Compliance Requirements:

The system must comply with GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) for data privacy, PCI-DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard) for secure transactions, and AML (Anti-Money Laundering) regulations.
Regular audits and reports to meet local financial and security regulations.
Resource Constraints:

The project must be completed within 18 months, with a moderate budget allocated for development, testing, and deployment.
Staff availability for ongoing maintenance and feature updates may be limited.
Integration Needs:

The system must integrate with existing banking infrastructure, credit rating agencies, third-party payment processors, and regulatory reporting systems.
Support for single sign-on (SSO) and other authentication systems used by corporate clients.
This scenario outlines a realistic financial system that integrates banking, investment management, loan processing, and budgeting tools. It considers key requirements like security, scalability, and compliance, while acknowledging the challenges of legacy system integration and resource limitations.
