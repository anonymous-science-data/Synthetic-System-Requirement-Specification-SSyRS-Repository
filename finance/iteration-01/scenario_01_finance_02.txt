Scenario: Finance Sector

1. System Overview
System Purpose:
The system aims to provide an integrated platform for retail banking and investment management, enabling customers to access their accounts, perform transactions, and manage investments from a single, secure interface. It also includes advanced analytics for portfolio tracking, automated financial planning tools, and real-time fraud detection capabilities.

Domain/Context:
The system operates in the finance sector, specifically focusing on retail banking, wealth management, and investment services.

Stakeholders:

Retail banking customers (individuals, families, and small businesses).
Investment customers (individuals and financial institutions).
Banking and financial advisors.
Internal banking staff (e.g., security officers, account managers).
Regulatory bodies (e.g., Federal Reserve, SEC).
Third-party service providers (e.g., payment processors, investment platforms).
User Base Characteristics:

A diverse global user base of millions, including individuals of varying financial literacy levels and small to medium-sized businesses.
Users span urban and rural areas, with a majority accessing the system via mobile apps and online platforms.
Roles include end customers, financial advisors, corporate clients, and administrative staff.
2. Functional Requirements
Core Features:

Secure user authentication and account access (including multi-factor authentication).
Real-time account balance viewing, transaction history, and activity alerts.
Loan management, including application, approval, and repayment tracking.
Investment portfolio management with real-time tracking and analysis tools.
Automated financial planning, including savings goals and budgeting assistance.
Fraud detection system with real-time transaction monitoring and alerting.
Personalization options for users to customize their dashboards and reporting features.
Frequency of Authentication:

Users must authenticate per session and when performing sensitive actions such as transferring funds or modifying account details.
High-sensitivity actions (e.g., large fund transfers, adding beneficiaries) require re-authentication through additional security steps.
Sensitivity of Actions:

High sensitivity: Funds transfers, account modifications, setting up or deleting accounts, investing large sums.
Medium sensitivity: Viewing detailed financial statements, applying for loans, credit report requests.
Low sensitivity: Viewing account balance, general transaction history, or available credit.
3. Non-Functional Requirements
Performance:

The system should have a maximum response time of 3 seconds for most user interactions and process up to 100,000 simultaneous users during peak periods without degradation in performance.
Scalability:

The system should be able to handle a 50% increase in user base annually and scale to accommodate growth in transaction volume, especially during tax season or market fluctuations.
Reliability:

System uptime should be 99.99%, with automatic failover mechanisms to minimize downtime.
Error logging and reporting mechanisms should be in place to track and resolve system failures quickly.
Security:

Multi-layer security protocols, including end-to-end encryption for sensitive data, role-based access control, and secure payment gateway integration.
Biometric authentication (fingerprint or facial recognition) for high-sensitivity operations.
Regular security audits and vulnerability assessments.
Usability:

The system should offer an intuitive user interface for both novice and experienced users.
It should be mobile-friendly, offering full functionality on mobile devices with a responsive design.
Features should be accessible for users with disabilities, supporting screen readers and other assistive technologies.
Multi-language support to cater to a global customer base.
4. Constraints
Technical Constraints:

Legacy infrastructure integration may limit certain functionalities during system upgrades.
The system must be compatible with both Android and iOS mobile platforms.
Integration with third-party financial institutionsâ€™ APIs could present challenges due to varying standards.
Compliance Requirements:

The system must comply with financial industry regulations like GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation), PCI-DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard), and AML (Anti-Money Laundering) standards.
Adherence to regional financial regulations (e.g., SEC rules in the U.S., MiFID II in Europe).
Resource Constraints:

The development team has a limited budget and a one-year timeline to launch the platform.
Staffing might be constrained in certain regions, requiring reliance on remote or outsourced development for parts of the project.
Integration Needs:

The system needs to integrate with existing banking infrastructure, including core banking systems, third-party financial data providers, and existing customer authentication systems (e.g., identity verification tools).
This scenario outlines a realistic financial system designed to meet the needs of diverse users while adhering to regulatory requirements, performance standards, and security considerations. It also acknowledges technical, resource, and integration constraints commonly faced by financial institutions when deploying new technology.
