Domain/Context:
This system operates in the financial services domain, focusing on securities trading and post-trade operations. It addresses inefficiencies in manual processes and ensures compliance with settlement regulations like T+1 in major markets.

Stakeholders:

Primary Users: Settlement analysts, operations managers, compliance officers.
Secondary Stakeholders: IT administrators, institutional traders, and external auditors.
External Stakeholders: Regulatory bodies and financial institutions relying on reconciliation data.
User Base Characteristics:

Approximately 3,500-7,000 active users, with 50% being operations staff, 30% compliance officers, and 20% IT administrators.
Users are located across North America, Europe, and Asia, reflecting the global nature of financial markets.
Roles include high-sensitivity users (e.g., compliance officers) and mid-sensitivity users (e.g., settlement analysts).
Operational Environment:

The platform is cloud-hosted, ensuring high availability and performance scalability.
Accessed via a web portal for detailed workflows and a mobile app for quick status updates and alerts.
Designed for a multi-region deployment to support users in different time zones with minimal latency.
Usage Scenarios:

Settlement analysts monitor daily transaction statuses and resolve exceptions.
Compliance officers generate reports to verify adherence to settlement regulations.
IT administrators configure integration settings and monitor system health.
Institutional traders access settlement statuses to confirm successful transactions.

Role-Based Access Control: Management of permissions based on user roles.
Authentication Conditions & Frequency:

Users authenticate at the beginning of each session.
Re-authentication is required for sensitive actions, such as changing integration settings or exporting large compliance datasets.
Sessions expire after 45 minutes of inactivity.
Sensitivity of Actions & Permission Levels:

High-Sensitivity Actions: Modifying reconciliation rules, configuring system settings (restricted to administrators and compliance officers).
