1. System Overview
System Purpose:
To build a robust fraud detection and prevention system for financial institutions, aimed at monitoring transactions in real-time, identifying suspicious activities, and reducing fraudulent losses. The system will leverage machine learning to adapt to emerging fraud patterns.

Domain/Context:
Finance sector, focusing on banking and payment processing.

Stakeholders:

Bank customers: Individuals and businesses conducting financial transactions.
Fraud analysts and risk management teams at banks.
Compliance officers ensuring adherence to anti-fraud regulations.
IT teams responsible for system implementation and maintenance.
User Base Characteristics:

Bank customers: Tens of millions of active users globally, accessing the system via mobile apps, online banking, and in-person branches.
Fraud analysts: A specialized team of thousands, primarily located in regional operational centers.
Geographic distribution: Global, with a focus on regions experiencing high transaction volumes, such as North America, Europe, and Asia.
2. Functional Requirements
Core Features:

Real-time monitoring and scoring of all transactions based on fraud risk.
Automatic flagging and blocking of high-risk transactions.
A dashboard for fraud analysts to review flagged transactions, with detailed risk analysis and suggested actions.
Integration with third-party fraud databases for enhanced detection capabilities.
User notifications for flagged activities, with options for reporting false positives.
Frequency of Authentication:

Customers authenticate once per session but may need re-authentication for actions like overriding a blocked transaction.
Fraud analysts require session-based authentication with timeouts after 30 minutes of inactivity.
Sensitivity of Actions:

High sensitivity: Releasing blocked transactions, accessing detailed user transaction histories.
Medium sensitivity: Adjusting risk thresholds, configuring fraud detection rules.
Low sensitivity: Viewing transaction logs and generating high-level reports.
3. Non-Functional Requirements
Performance:

Must process up to 100,000 transactions per second during peak hours with response times under 1 second for fraud detection.
Scalability:

Capable of handling a 50% increase in transaction volume during seasonal spikes or promotional periods.
Reliability:

99.999% uptime, with seamless failover mechanisms and zero data loss during recovery.
Recovery time objective (RTO) of less than 2 minutes.
Security:

End-to-end encryption for all customer and transaction data.
Multi-factor authentication (MFA) for fraud analysts.
Role-based access control (RBAC) for all users, with audit trails for sensitive actions.
Usability:

Fraud analysts dashboard must be intuitive, with minimal training required.
Accessibility features, including screen readers and high-contrast modes, for compliance with WCAG 2.1 standards.
4. Constraints
Technical Constraints:

Must integrate with existing core banking systems and payment gateways without disruptions.
Machine learning models must be deployable on cloud and on-premises environments.
Compliance Requirements:

Adherence to PSD2, GDPR, and AML (Anti-Money Laundering) regulations.
Regular audits and reporting to regulatory bodies.
Resource Constraints:

Development budget capped at $15 million.
Project timeline limited to 18 months, with phased delivery of features.
Integration Needs:

Compatibility with existing authentication systems, such as OAuth and SAML.
Real-time integration with transaction processing systems and external fraud intelligence networks.
