1. System Overview
System Purpose:
To develop a digital treasury management system (TMS) that centralizes cash management, liquidity forecasting, and payment processing for corporate finance departments. The system aims to enhance financial visibility, optimize cash flow, and improve decision-making through advanced analytics and automation.

Domain/Context:
Finance sector, specifically corporate treasury and cash management operations.

Stakeholders:

Corporate finance teams, including CFOs and treasury managers.
External stakeholders such as banks and financial institutions.
IT and system administrators managing infrastructure and support.
Compliance officers overseeing regulatory adherence.
User Base Characteristics:

Treasury managers and finance analysts: Approximately 50,000 users globally in large enterprises.
Banks and external institutions: Indirect users interacting via API integrations.
Geographic distribution: Predominantly multinational corporations operating across multiple time zones.
2. Functional Requirements
Core Features:

Centralized dashboard for cash positions, liquidity analysis, and forecasts.
Automated payment processing, with approval workflows for high-value transactions.
Integration with ERP systems for real-time financial data consolidation.
Reporting tools to generate compliance, audit, and performance reports.
Predictive analytics to identify future liquidity challenges and optimize investments.
Frequency of Authentication:

Finance team users authenticate per session and re-authenticate for high-risk actions, such as releasing payments above specified thresholds.
External users (e.g., bank representatives) authenticate via secure API tokens for integration purposes.
Sensitivity of Actions:

High sensitivity: Approval of large-scale transactions, access to detailed cash flow forecasts.
Medium sensitivity: Modifying forecasting models and report configurations.
Low sensitivity: Viewing consolidated dashboards and generating reports.
3. Non-Functional Requirements
Performance:

System must support up to 10,000 concurrent users with response times under 2 seconds for dashboard updates.
Must handle 1 million payment transactions per day without performance degradation.
Scalability:

Ability to scale horizontally to support a 25% annual growth in transaction volume and users.
Reliability:

System uptime must be 99.98%, with recovery time objective (RTO) under 10 minutes and recovery point objective (RPO) under 5 minutes.
Security:

Data encryption at rest and in transit.
Multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all users.
Role-based access control (RBAC) for granular permission settings.
Full audit trails for all user actions and system changes.
Usability:

Simple, intuitive user interface tailored for treasury professionals.
Accessible design, ensuring compliance with accessibility standards such as WCAG 2.1.
4. Constraints
Technical Constraints:

Must be deployable in both on-premises and cloud environments.
Compatibility with existing ERP systems such as SAP and Oracle Financials.
Compliance Requirements:

Adherence to ISO 20022 for payment processing and SWIFT standards for financial messaging.
Compliance with GDPR for data protection in Europe and equivalent regional regulations elsewhere.
Resource Constraints:

Development budget capped at $20 million.
Project duration limited to 15 months, with initial release planned within 9 months.
Integration Needs:

Seamless integration with external bank APIs for transaction processing.
Compatibility with authentication protocols such as OAuth 2.0 and SAML.
