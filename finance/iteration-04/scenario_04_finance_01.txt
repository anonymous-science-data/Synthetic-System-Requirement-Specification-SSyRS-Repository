Scenario: Real-Time Fraud Detection and Prevention System for a Digital Banking Platform

1. System Overview
System Purpose:
The system aims to provide real-time fraud detection and prevention capabilities for a digital banking platform, protecting customers' assets and ensuring trust in financial transactions. It will monitor transaction activity, analyze behavior patterns, and flag or block suspicious activities.

Domain/Context:
The system operates in the finance domain, specifically within the context of digital banking and financial services.

Stakeholders:

Primary Stakeholders: Bank executives (concerned with risk reduction), fraud analysts, and IT security teams.
Secondary Stakeholders: Retail and business banking customers, regulatory agencies, and technology partners.
User Base Characteristics:
The user base includes:

Retail customers: Millions of geographically dispersed users accessing the system via mobile apps, web platforms, and ATMs.
Corporate users: A smaller segment accessing higher-value transactional services.
Administrators and fraud analysts: A centralized team responsible for monitoring and taking action on flagged activities.
2. Functional Requirements
Core Features:

Real-time transaction monitoring and analysis using AI/ML models.
Automated flagging and escalation of suspicious transactions.
Customer notification and response mechanisms (e.g., SMS or email alerts with temporary account freezing options).
Fraud case management system for analysts to investigate flagged transactions.
API integration with external credit bureaus and fraud databases.
Frequency of Authentication:

Standard authentication: Required at the start of every user session (e.g., biometric or password).
Sensitive actions (e.g., high-value transfers, adding a new beneficiary): Multi-factor authentication (MFA) required for every such operation.
Sensitivity of Actions:

Low sensitivity: Checking account balances or viewing transaction history.
Medium sensitivity: Bill payments and low-value transfers.
High sensitivity: High-value transactions, cross-border payments, and profile changes (e.g., updating contact information).
3. Non-Functional Requirements
Performance:

Real-time processing of up to 10,000 transactions per second with a maximum latency of 1 second for fraud detection.
Scalability:

Capable of handling a 50% increase in transaction volume during peak times (e.g., holidays, end of the month).
Reliability:

99.99% system uptime.
Fault-tolerant mechanisms to reroute transactions to backup systems in case of primary system failures.
Security:

End-to-end encryption for all transaction data.
Strict role-based access control (RBAC) for administrators.
Compliance with PCI DSS and ISO 27001 standards.
Usability:

Intuitive fraud case dashboards for analysts with advanced filtering and visualization tools.
Seamless customer interactions with minimal disruptions during fraud investigations.
4. Constraints
Technical Constraints:

The system must integrate with the bank's existing legacy core banking systems.
AI models must operate on cloud-based infrastructure compliant with banking security standards.
Compliance Requirements:

Adherence to GDPR for handling customer data in the EU.
Compliance with Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Know Your Customer (KYC) regulations.
Resource Constraints:

A development budget of $5 million, with a project timeline of 18 months.
Limited availability of in-house AI/ML expertise, requiring third-party consultants.
Integration Needs:

The system must seamlessly integrate with existing authentication mechanisms, including MFA and mobile app-based push notifications.
Interoperability with external fraud intelligence feeds and payment processing systems.
This scenario highlights challenges unique to financial systems, such as real-time performance requirements, stringent security measures, and regulatory compliance, while detailing actionable functional and non-functional requirements.
