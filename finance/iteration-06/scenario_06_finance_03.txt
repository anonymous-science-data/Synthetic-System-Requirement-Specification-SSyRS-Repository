Scenario: Cross-Border Trade Finance Automation System
1. System Overview
System Purpose:
The system aims to streamline cross-border trade finance by automating document verification, payment scheduling, and compliance checks. It reduces manual processing time, enhances transparency, and minimizes risks associated with international trade transactions.

Domain/Context:
This system operates in the trade finance domain, addressing inefficiencies in processing letters of credit, invoice financing, and compliance with international trade regulations.

Stakeholders:

Exporters and Importers: Businesses engaged in cross-border trade who use the system to streamline financing and documentation.
Banks and Financial Institutions: Offer trade finance services, manage credit risk, and process payments.
Regulatory Authorities: Ensure adherence to anti-money laundering (AML) laws and trade compliance.
System Administrators: Maintain the system and ensure seamless operations.
User Base Characteristics:

Size: Approximately 30,000 users initially, with projections of 15% annual growth as adoption spreads to smaller exporters and regional banks.
Diversity: Includes large multinational corporations, small-to-medium enterprises (SMEs), and multiple banks.
Geographic Distribution: Global, with a focus on trade hubs in Asia, Europe, and North America.
Roles: Exporters/importers, bank officers, compliance officers, and system administrators.
Operational Environment:
The system is hosted on a cloud-based platform to support global accessibility and integrates with on-premise banking systems for data synchronization where required by local regulations.

Usage Scenarios:

Exporters upload trade documents for verification and track the progress of financing approvals.
Banks verify documents, assess credit risk, and process payments to exporters.
Compliance officers audit flagged transactions and ensure adherence to trade and AML regulations.
2. Functional Requirements
Core Features:

Document Verification: Automate the validation of trade documents such as invoices, shipping manifests, and letters of credit using AI/ML.
Payment Scheduling: Enable exporters and importers to schedule and track payments in multiple currencies.
Compliance Checks: Screen transactions for sanctions, AML risks, and trade regulation violations.
Audit Trail: Provide a detailed record of all actions taken during the transaction lifecycle.
Alerts and Notifications: Notify stakeholders of approvals, discrepancies, or required actions in real-time.
Authentication Conditions & Frequency:

Session Authentication: Users authenticate once per session, with sessions expiring after 4 hours of inactivity.
Sensitive Actions: Re-authentication required for approving payments above $100,000 or altering trade finance agreements.
Escalation Actions: Compliance officers performing overrides must re-authenticate with additional logging of justification.
Sensitivity of Actions & Permission Levels:

Exporters/Importers: Can upload documents, track status, and schedule payments but cannot override compliance flags.
Bank Officers: Have permissions to approve financing, flag high-risk transactions, and manage payment schedules.
Compliance Officers: Have full access to flagged transactions and audit logs but cannot modify payment details.
3. Non-Functional Requirements
Performance:

Process 5,000 documents per hour with a verification latency under 3 seconds for 90% of documents.
Handle up to 2,000 concurrent users during peak hours without performance degradation.
Scalability:

Support growth to 100,000 users and a 10x increase in transaction volume within 5 years.
Use scalable microservices architecture to manage spikes in usage during trade surges.
Reliability:

Ensure 99.9% uptime with real-time failover for critical systems.
Conduct hourly backups of transaction data and provide full recovery capabilities within 1 hour of a failure.
Security:

Encrypt all trade documents and payment details at rest and in transit.
Implement role-based access control (RBAC) to enforce least-privilege access.
Usability:

Provide intuitive dashboards tailored to each user role (e.g., exporters, bank officers).
Ensure WCAG 2.1 compliance for accessibility.
Audit & Monitoring:

Log all user actions, authentication events, and transaction data changes.
Generate real-time alerts for suspicious activities such as document tampering or unusual payment patterns.
4. Constraints
Technical Constraints:

The system must integrate with SWIFT and local payment networks while maintaining low latency.
Machine learning models for document verification must be retrained every 6 months with new trade data.
Compliance Requirements:

Adherence to AML regulations, GDPR, and country-specific trade compliance laws.
Ensure real-time screening against sanctions lists such as OFAC and UN.
Resource Constraints:

Initial development budget of $10 million with an 18-month timeline.
A core team of 30 developers, including specialists in AI/ML and trade finance.
Integration Needs:

Seamless integration with banking systems, including core banking and payment processing solutions.
APIs to connect with third-party compliance services for sanctions screening and AML monitoring.
This scenario provides a realistic and coherent solution addressing the challenges of cross-border trade finance automation while aligning with business goals, regulatory requirements, and technical constraints.
