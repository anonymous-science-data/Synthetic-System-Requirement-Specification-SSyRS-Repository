1. System Overview
System Purpose:
The system, "Financial Risk Analysis and Reporting Suite" (FRARS), is designed to automate the identification, assessment, and reporting of credit and market risks for mid- to large-sized banks. It provides real-time risk scoring, stress testing, and automated regulatory reporting to ensure compliance with Basel III standards. The goal is to improve decision-making and reduce operational inefficiencies in risk management.

Domain/Context:
The system operates within the finance industry, specifically targeting credit and market risk management for commercial and investment banks.

Stakeholders:

Primary Users: Risk managers, credit analysts, and compliance officers.
Secondary Stakeholders: IT administrators, external auditors, and C-level executives (e.g., CROs, CFOs).
External Stakeholders: Regulators and audit firms requiring detailed risk reports.
User Base Characteristics:

Estimated 2,000 users across 25 financial institutions.
Roles include analysts (60%), senior risk managers (25%), and IT/admin staff (15%).
Users are distributed globally, with concentrations in North America, Europe, and Asia-Pacific.
Operational Environment:

Cloud-based deployment using secure, regional data centers compliant with GDPR and other jurisdictional regulations.
Accessible via web browsers with a desktop application for intensive data analysis.
Mobile dashboards for executives to view high-level risk metrics on demand.
Usage Scenarios:

A risk manager performs a daily risk assessment using real-time data feeds from market indices and internal banking systems.
A compliance officer generates and reviews stress test reports before submitting them to regulators.
A credit analyst evaluates the risk score of a loan portfolio to determine its suitability for approval.
IT administrators monitor user permissions and configure system settings to meet organizational policies.
2. Functional Requirements
Core Features:

Risk Scoring: Generate real-time credit and market risk scores based on internal and external data.
Stress Testing: Automated simulations to evaluate portfolio performance under adverse market conditions.
Regulatory Reporting: Pre-configured templates for Basel III compliance, including reports for risk-weighted assets and capital adequacy ratios.
Portfolio Analysis: Tools for segmenting and analyzing portfolios by risk metrics, geography, or asset class.
Integration Services: APIs to connect with core banking systems, market data providers, and third-party risk models.
Authentication Conditions & Frequency:

Login Authentication: Required at the start of every session.
Re-Authentication: Mandatory for accessing sensitive data, such as regulatory reports or modifying risk models.
Session Expiration: After 20 minutes of inactivity.
Sensitivity of Actions & Permission Levels:

High Sensitivity: Stress testing and regulatory reporting (restricted to senior risk managers and compliance officers).
Moderate Sensitivity: Portfolio analysis and risk scoring (available to risk managers and analysts).
Low Sensitivity: Viewing dashboards and general system reports (accessible to all authorized users).
3. Non-Functional Requirements

Response time for most actions under 2 seconds, with up to 5 seconds for complex stress test calculations.
Capable of processing 10,000 risk scores per minute under peak loads.
Scalability:

Support up to 5,000 concurrent users and a 300% increase in transaction volume without performance degradation.
Reliability:

99.95% uptime with redundant systems to ensure continuous operation.
Recovery Point Objective (RPO): 10 minutes; Recovery Time Objective (RTO): 30 minutes.
Security:

Data encrypted at rest and in transit.
Role-based access control (RBAC) with support for multi-tenant environments.
Usability:
