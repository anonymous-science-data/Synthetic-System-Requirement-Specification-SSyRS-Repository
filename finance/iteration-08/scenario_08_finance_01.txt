Secondary Stakeholders: IT administrators, auditors, and executives (CFOs, CROs).
External Stakeholders: Regulatory bodies requiring compliance reporting, external auditors.
User Base Characteristics:

Approximately 1,500 users across 50 mid-sized institutions.
Roles include analysts (70%), senior managers (20%), and IT/admin staff (10%).
Users are geographically distributed across North America and Europe.
User experience levels vary from tech-savvy analysts to non-technical managers.
Operational Environment:

Cloud-hosted solution deployed on a secure, scalable infrastructure.
Accessible via web browsers and a dedicated mobile app for on-the-go operations.
Integrates with core banking systems and external market data providers through APIs.
Usage Scenarios:

A treasury manager logs in to generate a daily liquidity position report.
A compliance officer reviews automated alerts for liquidity threshold breaches.
An analyst schedules an interbank transfer and simulates its impact on liquidity forecasts.
IT administrators configure user permissions and review audit logs for security compliance.

Scalability:

System must scale to accommodate up to 5,000 users and a 200% increase in transaction volumes.
Reliability:

99.9% uptime, with automated failover mechanisms in place.
Recovery Point Objective (RPO): 15 minutes; Recovery Time Objective (RTO): 1 hour.
Security:

End-to-end encryption for all data in transit and at rest.
Role-based access control (RBAC) with granular permissions.
Usability:

Accessible interfaces for users with limited technical skills.
