    Adherence to Basel III, IFRS 9, GDPR (for European users), and local lending regulations in target regions.
    Support for periodic regulatory filings and compliance reporting.

Resource Constraints:

    Budget: $10 million for development and deployment.
    Timeline: 18 months, including testing and initial deployment.
    Team Size: 80 members (data scientists, developers, risk experts, compliance specialists, project managers).

Integration Needs:

    Integration with external credit bureaus and financial market data providers for real-time risk scoring inputs.
    Seamless interoperability with existing loan origination systems (LOS) used by financial institutions.

This scenario is distinct and realistic, addressing the specific challenges of risk assessment and management in the Finance domain. It introduces diverse features, a medium-sized user base, and compliance-heavy constraints, ensuring alignment with best practices.
