Scenario: Intelligent Inventory Management System (IIMS)
1. System Overview
System Purpose:
The Intelligent Inventory Management System (IIMS) is designed to optimize inventory management processes for mid-sized and large retail chains. Its primary goals include minimizing stockouts, reducing overstock, and improving supply chain efficiency through predictive analytics and real-time inventory tracking.

Domain/Context:
The system operates in the Retail and Supply-Chain industry, catering to businesses with multiple warehouses and retail outlets. It leverages advanced technologies such as IoT sensors, machine learning algorithms, and cloud computing.

Stakeholders:

Retail Chain Managers: Use the system for strategic decision-making.
Warehouse Supervisors: Monitor inventory levels and coordinate stock movements.
Store Managers: Access real-time inventory data to ensure product availability.
IT Administrators: Maintain the system and ensure seamless operation.
Suppliers: Integrate into the system to provide timely stock replenishments.
User Base Characteristics:

Size: Approximately 20,000 users across 500 retail outlets and 15 warehouses.
Diversity: Includes managerial, operational, and technical roles.
Geographic Distribution: Users are spread across multiple regions, with some warehouses in remote locations.
Roles: Vary from strategic planners to on-the-ground workers needing tailored interfaces.
2. Functional Requirements
Core Features:

Real-Time Inventory Monitoring: Tracks stock levels using IoT sensors and RFID tags.
Predictive Reordering: Uses AI to forecast demand and suggest restocking schedules.
Centralized Dashboard: Provides an overview of inventory metrics, such as turnover rates and slow-moving stock.
Alerts and Notifications: Sends automated alerts for critical events like stock depletion or delivery delays.
Supplier Integration: Allows seamless communication and order processing with suppliers.
Mobile Access: Enables on-the-go inventory management through a mobile app.
Frequency of Authentication:

Per Session: For mobile and web app users.
Per Action: For critical operations like order approval or system configuration changes.
Sensitivity of Actions:

High: Approving large-scale reorders, modifying predictive models, or overriding stock thresholds.
Medium: Generating reports, assigning tasks, or updating product categories.
Low: Viewing stock levels or shipment statuses.
3. Non-Functional Requirements
Performance:

System response time must be under 2 seconds for 95% of user interactions.
Capable of processing up to 500,000 inventory updates per minute during peak hours.
Scalability:

The system should scale to accommodate up to 50% growth in outlets and warehouses over the next five years.
Reliability:

Must achieve 99.9% uptime with robust failover mechanisms to ensure availability during outages.
Security:

Employs end-to-end encryption for data transmission.
Multi-factor authentication for all users.
Role-based access control to prevent unauthorized operations.
Usability:

Interfaces must be intuitive and available in multiple languages.
Compliant with accessibility standards (e.g., WCAG 2.1).
4. Constraints
Technical Constraints:

The system must integrate with legacy ERP systems currently in use.
Limited support for on-premises deployment; primarily cloud-based.
Compliance Requirements:

Adheres to GDPR for European operations.
Ensures compliance with industry-specific standards such as ISO 27001.
Resource Constraints:

Initial budget of $3 million for development and rollout.
Development timeframe limited to 18 months.
Integration Needs:

Seamless synchronization with supplier portals and third-party logistics systems.
Compatibility with existing authentication systems, such as SSO (Single Sign-On) solutions.
This scenario is designed to address key challenges in the retail supply chain by leveraging cutting-edge technologies while adhering to industry standards and practical constraints.
