Scenario: Smart Demand Planning and Optimization System (SDPOS)
1. System Overview
System Purpose:
The Smart Demand Planning and Optimization System (SDPOS) is designed to enhance demand forecasting accuracy and optimize inventory allocation across multiple distribution centers and retail outlets. Its main goals include reducing excess inventory, preventing stockouts, and aligning supply with dynamic market demands.

Domain/Context:
This system operates in the Retail and Supply-Chain industry, with a focus on businesses managing diverse product categories and seasonal fluctuations.

Stakeholders:

Demand Planners: Analyze forecasts and make informed decisions about stock levels.
Supply Chain Managers: Oversee inventory allocation and logistics coordination.
Retail Store Managers: Ensure stores are adequately stocked to meet customer needs.
IT Teams: Maintain system infrastructure and manage integrations.
Suppliers: Align production schedules with forecasted demand.
User Base Characteristics:

Size: Approximately 15,000 users, including corporate and on-ground operational staff.
Diversity: Includes analysts, logistics personnel, and retail associates with varying technical expertise.
Geographic Distribution: Covers urban and remote locations in regions with differing market dynamics.
Roles: Encompasses strategic planners, operational managers, and system administrators.
2. Functional Requirements
Core Features:

AI-Powered Demand Forecasting: Leverages machine learning to analyze historical data, seasonal trends, and external factors like weather or holidays.
Dynamic Reallocation Engine: Adjusts inventory distribution in real-time based on sales trends and forecast deviations.
Collaborative Planning Module: Allows demand planners to collaboratively review and adjust forecasts.
Supplier Collaboration Portal: Facilitates communication and production planning with suppliers.
Scenario Analysis Tool: Simulates different demand scenarios to evaluate risk and optimize decisions.
Alerts and Recommendations: Provides proactive alerts for forecast anomalies and suggests corrective actions.
Frequency of Authentication:

Per Session: For regular use by planners, managers, and store associates.
Per Action: Required for sensitive changes like approving bulk reorders or modifying algorithms.
Sensitivity of Actions:

High: Overriding demand forecasts, changing inventory thresholds, or approving system recommendations.
Medium: Generating forecast reports or adjusting local inventory levels.
Low: Viewing demand trends or accessing supplier communications.
3. Non-Functional Requirements
Performance:

Predictive models must update forecasts within 30 minutes of receiving new data inputs.
System response time under 2 seconds for dashboard interactions and forecast reviews.
Scalability:

Designed to handle data from 1,000+ retail outlets and distribution centers, with 20% year-over-year growth.
Reliability:

System uptime of 99.9%, with failover mechanisms for data processing during outages.
Security:

Role-based access control for different user types.
End-to-end encryption for all communications between system modules.
Compliance with industry standards for data protection, such as ISO 27001.
Usability:

Simple and intuitive interface, with drag-and-drop functionality for scenario analysis.
Supports mobile and desktop access, ensuring ease of use for all roles.
4. Constraints
Technical Constraints:

Must integrate seamlessly with existing ERP, WMS (Warehouse Management Systems), and POS systems.
Limited on-premises deployment capability; system primarily designed for cloud infrastructure.
Compliance Requirements:

Must adhere to GDPR for operations in Europe.
Ensures compliance with industry-specific data retention policies.
Resource Constraints:

Development budget set at $5 million, with ongoing operational costs capped at $500,000 annually.
Implementation and rollout planned within 20 months.
Integration Needs:

Compatible with supplier systems for real-time production updates.
Must support APIs for easy integration with third-party analytics tools.
This scenario captures a realistic and forward-thinking solution for demand planning and inventory optimization, addressing key challenges in the Retail and Supply-Chain sector while considering practical constraints.
