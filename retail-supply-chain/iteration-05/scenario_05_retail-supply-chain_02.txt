Retail and Supply-Chain Scenario: Omni-Channel Customer Engagement and Fulfillment System (OCEFS)
1. System Overview
System Purpose:
The Omni-Channel Customer Engagement and Fulfillment System (OCEFS) is designed to unify customer interactions and streamline fulfillment across in-store, online, and third-party marketplace channels. Its primary goal is to enhance customer experience by providing consistent product availability, accurate order tracking, and flexible delivery options.

Domain/Context:
The retail and supply-chain domain with a focus on omni-channel operations, including e-commerce, physical retail, and direct-to-consumer models. The system facilitates seamless integration between customer touchpoints and back-end fulfillment processes.

Stakeholders:

Customers: Expecting real-time product availability, order tracking, and flexible delivery/pickup options.
Retail Managers: Overseeing inventory and sales performance across channels.
Logistics and Fulfillment Teams: Managing order picking, packing, and delivery schedules.
IT Teams: Ensuring system uptime, security, and scalability.
User Base Characteristics:

Size: Approximately 10,000 concurrent users during peak holiday sales.
Diversity: Roles include store associates, warehouse workers, delivery personnel, and online customer support agents.
Geographic Distribution: U.S., Europe, and Latin America, with a mix of urban and rural operations.
Operational Environment:
The system operates on a cloud-native platform with mobile-optimized interfaces for warehouse and delivery staff, and API integrations for third-party logistics providers. Localized data centers support faster processing in key regions.

Usage Scenarios:

Customers search for product availability across online and in-store channels.
Store associates use handheld devices to locate items for in-store pickup orders.
Warehouse staff process online orders, updating customers with real-time fulfillment status.
Logistics teams allocate delivery resources based on regional demand.
IT teams monitor system performance and resolve downtime incidents.
2. Functional Requirements
Core Features:

Unified Inventory Management: Real-time visibility into stock across warehouses, stores, and in-transit locations.
Order Fulfillment Workflow: Tools to manage order processing from receipt to delivery.
Customer Engagement Portal: Allowing customers to check order status, modify delivery options, and contact support.
Dynamic Delivery Scheduling: Integration with third-party logistics for real-time scheduling and route optimization.
Returns and Exchanges: Simplified processes for customers to initiate returns, with real-time updates to stock levels.
Authentication Conditions & Frequency:

Users authenticate at the start of their shifts using role-based credentials and MFA.
Re-authentication is required for actions like overriding system-generated inventory counts or approving refunds above a threshold.
Sensitivity of Actions & Permission Levels:

High Sensitivity: Modifying inventory thresholds, approving large-scale stock transfers (Manager roles).
Medium Sensitivity: Adjusting order fulfillment statuses or creating manual shipments (Fulfillment staff).
Low Sensitivity: Viewing inventory levels or order details (General staff and store associates).
3. Non-Functional Requirements
Performance:

Average response time under 1.5 seconds for 95% of customer-facing actions.
Support up to 1,500 order updates per second during peak sales events.
Scalability:

Expandable to handle a 100% increase in user activity and transaction volume during major sales events, such as Black Friday.
Reliability:

99.95% uptime SLA, with disaster recovery plans ensuring minimal data loss in critical failures.
Security:

All customer and transaction data encrypted in transit and at rest.
Continuous monitoring for unauthorized access or anomalies in user behavior.

4. Constraints
Technical Constraints:

Integration required with existing ERP systems, third-party logistics platforms, and payment gateways.
Must support legacy barcode scanning hardware in warehouses for at least 2 years during phased upgrades.
Compliance Requirements:

Must comply with GDPR for European customers and CCPA for California-based users.
Adhere to PCI-DSS standards for handling payment information.
Resource Constraints:

Development budget limited to $5 million over a 24-month timeline.
