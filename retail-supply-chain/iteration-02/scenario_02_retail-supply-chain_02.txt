Retail and Supply-Chain Scenario
1. System Overview
System Purpose:
The system is designed to streamline last-mile delivery operations, improve warehouse efficiency, and enhance customer satisfaction by using dynamic routing, inventory synchronization, and AI-powered demand planning.

Domain/Context:
Retail and supply-chain logistics, focusing on e-commerce and omnichannel retailers with a significant delivery component.

Stakeholders:

Retailers (e-commerce managers, fulfillment teams).
Third-party logistics (3PL) companies.
Delivery personnel.
Customers (end-users of delivery services).
System administrators and developers.
User Base Characteristics:

Size: Tens of thousands of users, including retail staff, drivers, and end-customers.
Diversity: Users vary widely in technical expertise, ranging from delivery personnel using mobile apps to data analysts working on dashboards.
Geographic Distribution: Global user base with operations spanning urban and rural areas, often across multiple time zones.
Roles: Operational (warehouse managers, drivers), strategic (supply chain planners), and technical (system administrators).
2. Functional Requirements
Core Features:

Real-time dynamic route optimization for delivery drivers.
Integration of warehouse automation with robotic pick-and-pack systems.
Customer self-service portal for live tracking and order modifications.
AI-driven inventory allocation to optimize stock levels across multiple fulfillment centers.
Alerts for delayed shipments or inventory shortages.
Advanced analytics dashboard for supply chain KPIs.
Frequency of Authentication:

Daily authentication for delivery personnel and warehouse staff.
Persistent authentication with periodic revalidation for customer-facing apps.
Per-session authentication for administrative users handling sensitive data.
Sensitivity of Actions:

High sensitivity: Modifying inventory allocation strategies, overriding delivery routes.
Medium sensitivity: Accessing customer data for support.
Low sensitivity: Viewing delivery statuses and supply chain metrics.
3. Non-Functional Requirements
Performance:

Sub-second response time for route optimization algorithms.
Real-time updates for customer tracking with minimal latency.
Scalability:

Capable of supporting 50% annual growth in user base and delivery volumes.
Cloud-native architecture to dynamically scale during peak seasons, such as holidays.
Reliability:

99.95% uptime with geo-redundant data centers.
Automatic error recovery for failed deliveries, with fallback routes generated in seconds.
Security:

Multi-factor authentication (MFA) for admin and driver accounts.
Encrypted APIs for warehouse and customer data exchange.
Regular penetration testing to identify vulnerabilities.
Usability:

User-friendly mobile app for drivers with offline capabilities.
Simple, accessible customer portal with multilingual support.
Role-specific dashboards for different stakeholders, reducing clutter and improving focus.
4. Constraints
Technical Constraints:

Must operate seamlessly on low-bandwidth mobile networks for remote delivery areas.
Compatibility with legacy systems in warehouses during initial deployment.
Compliance Requirements:

GDPR compliance for handling customer data in the EU.
Adherence to transportation regulations, such as proof of delivery standards.
Resource Constraints:

Limited to a 9-month rollout period for core functionalities.
Budget constraints prioritize delivery features over advanced analytics in the initial phase.
Integration Needs:

Integration with existing CRM and ERP systems.
APIs to connect with third-party delivery platforms and vehicle telematics systems.
This scenario represents a cutting-edge retail and supply-chain system designed to address challenges in last-mile delivery, inventory management, and customer satisfaction, with an emphasis on modern technology and practical constraints.
