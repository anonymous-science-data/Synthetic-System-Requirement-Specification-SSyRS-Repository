Retail and Supply-Chain Scenario
1. System Overview
System Purpose:
To develop a centralized supply-chain collaboration platform that enhances vendor-retailer communication, optimizes stock replenishment cycles, and reduces waste through real-time demand sensing and supplier coordination.

Domain/Context:
Retail and supply-chain management, with a focus on sustainability and collaboration between retailers and suppliers.

Stakeholders:

Retailers (store managers, procurement officers, and sustainability teams).
Suppliers (manufacturers, distributors).
Logistics providers (transportation companies).
End customers (benefiting from improved product availability and reduced delays).
IT teams (supporting the system's operations).
User Base Characteristics:

Size: Thousands of retailers and suppliers, with varying operational scales.
Diversity: Users range from small-scale local producers to multinational retail chains.
Geographic Distribution: System spans urban and rural areas, with localized supplier-retailer networks.
Roles: Operational (order managers, warehouse workers), strategic (supply-chain planners, sustainability leads), and technical (system administrators).
2. Functional Requirements
Core Features:

Collaborative inventory planning dashboards for suppliers and retailers.
Automated stock replenishment suggestions based on real-time sales and forecasts.
Sustainability tracking (e.g., carbon footprint of supply-chain activities).
Dispute resolution tools for order discrepancies.
Alerts for critical supply chain events, such as production delays or shipment disruptions.
Data analytics for tracking supplier performance and customer satisfaction metrics.
Frequency of Authentication:

Per-session authentication for standard users (e.g., procurement officers, store managers).
Transaction-based authentication for high-sensitivity operations like approving large orders.
Sensitivity of Actions:

High sensitivity: Overriding stock replenishment suggestions, approving supplier contracts.
Medium sensitivity: Accessing sustainability tracking reports and performance analytics.
Low sensitivity: Viewing shipment statuses and real-time inventory updates.
3. Non-Functional Requirements
Performance:

Dashboards must load within 2 seconds under normal conditions.
The system should support processing up to 500 concurrent order updates per minute.
Scalability:

Designed to accommodate a 200% increase in users during peak shopping seasons.
Support for integrating new supplier networks with minimal downtime.
Reliability:

99.9% system uptime with fail-safe mechanisms for critical workflows.
Real-time data backups to ensure no loss during outages.
Security:

Role-based access controls (RBAC) for different user groups.
Encryption for all data at rest and in transit.
Regular vulnerability assessments and penetration testing.
Usability:

Intuitive, multilingual user interface for global accessibility.
Mobile-optimized interface for on-the-go use by logistics providers and store managers.
Customizable dashboards to suit different roles.
4. Constraints
Technical Constraints:

Must integrate seamlessly with legacy ERP systems used by many suppliers.
Limited support for offline functionality, requiring consistent internet connectivity.
Compliance Requirements:

Adherence to GDPR for data privacy in the EU.
Compliance with ISO 28000 standards for supply-chain security.
Resource Constraints:

Development team limited to 10 engineers for the initial 12-month build phase.
Budget prioritization for sustainability features over advanced analytics.
Integration Needs:

API support for connecting to third-party logistics platforms and retail POS systems.
Compatibility with existing sustainability reporting tools used by stakeholders.
This scenario emphasizes collaboration, sustainability, and operational efficiency in the retail and supply-chain sector, with a focus on overcoming challenges through innovative technology and strategic design.
