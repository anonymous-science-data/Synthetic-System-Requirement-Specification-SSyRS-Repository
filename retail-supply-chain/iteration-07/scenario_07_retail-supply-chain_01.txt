Retail and Supply Chain Software System Requirements Scenario
1. System Overview
System Purpose:
The system is designed to streamline inventory management, enhance supply chain visibility, and optimize order fulfillment for a mid-sized retail chain operating in multiple regions. Its primary goal is to reduce inventory carrying costs, minimize stockouts, and improve order accuracy.

Domain/Context:
The system operates in the retail and supply chain domain, specifically catering to a company with a network of physical stores, regional warehouses, and an e-commerce platform.

Stakeholders:

Retail Operations Managers: Oversee in-store inventory and sales trends.
Supply Chain Managers: Plan and manage procurement, transportation, and warehousing.
Store Employees: Use the system for inventory lookup and stock replenishment.
IT Administrators: Manage system uptime, data security, and integrations.
Customers: Indirect beneficiaries through improved availability and order accuracy.
User Base Characteristics:

Size: Approximately 2,500 users, including corporate staff, store employees, and supply chain personnel.
Diversity: Users range from store-level employees with minimal technical expertise to IT and supply chain professionals with advanced domain knowledge.
Geographic Distribution: Primarily North America, with some suppliers and logistics providers in Asia and Europe.
Roles: Store staff, warehouse personnel, logistics planners, procurement specialists, and system administrators.
Operational Environment:
The system is cloud-based, accessed through web and mobile interfaces. Store employees primarily use tablet devices, while warehouse and corporate users access the system via desktop computers.

Usage Scenarios:

Store staff scanning barcodes to check real-time stock levels or reorder low-stock items.
Supply chain managers tracking inbound shipments and monitoring delays.
Warehouse employees picking and packing orders based on automatically generated picking lists.
IT administrators monitoring system health and generating compliance reports.
2. Functional Requirements
Core Features:

Real-time inventory tracking across stores, warehouses, and online channels.
Automated stock replenishment suggestions based on predefined thresholds and sales trends.
Integration with logistics providers for shipment tracking and delivery updates.
Order fulfillment workflows, including picking, packing, and shipping modules.
Analytics dashboards for sales, inventory, and supply chain performance metrics.
Authentication Conditions & Frequency:

Users must authenticate at the start of every session.
Re-authentication is required for sensitive actions, such as modifying inventory thresholds or exporting reports.
Sessions expire after 12 hours of inactivity for store-level users and 4 hours for corporate and IT roles.
Sensitivity of Actions & Permission Levels:

High Sensitivity: Adjusting procurement plans, modifying supplier information (Supply Chain Managers, IT Admins).
Medium Sensitivity: Editing inventory levels, reviewing sales forecasts (Store Managers, Warehouse Supervisors).
Low Sensitivity: Viewing stock levels, tracking shipments (Store Employees, Warehouse Workers).
3. Non-Functional Requirements
Performance:

System response time for core operations (e.g., inventory lookup, order updates) must not exceed 2 seconds.
Support up to 10,000 concurrent transactions with no more than a 5% performance degradation.
Scalability:

Handle a 30% increase in users or data volume during peak shopping seasons (e.g., Black Friday).
Reliability:

99.95% system uptime, with automated recovery from hardware failures within 5 minutes.
Daily backups with a recovery point objective (RPO) of 24 hours and recovery time objective (RTO) of 2 hours.
Security:

Role-based access control (RBAC) for all users.
Data encryption in transit and at rest using industry-standard protocols.
Usability:

Intuitive dashboards and workflows designed for quick task completion, targeting a learning curve of less than 2 hours for new users.
Accessibility compliance with WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards.
Audit & Monitoring:

Log all user actions related to inventory adjustments, order fulfillment, and system configurations.
Maintain logs for a minimum of 12 months, with alerting for unauthorized access attempts or unusual activities.
4. Constraints
Technical Constraints:

Integration with legacy ERP software used by the company for financial reporting.
Limited bandwidth availability in some remote warehouse locations.
Compliance Requirements:

GDPR compliance for handling supplier and customer data.
PCI DSS compliance for processing payment-related data in the e-commerce module.
Resource Constraints:

Budget: $2.5 million allocated for development, testing, and deployment.
Staffing: Core team of 15, including developers, QA specialists, business analysts, and project managers.
Integration Needs:

Connect with third-party logistics providers for shipment tracking APIs.
Interface with existing point-of-sale (POS) systems in stores for real-time sales data integration.
This scenario is a balanced, realistic approach to developing a system tailored to the retail and supply chain domain, addressing both business goals and technical considerations.
