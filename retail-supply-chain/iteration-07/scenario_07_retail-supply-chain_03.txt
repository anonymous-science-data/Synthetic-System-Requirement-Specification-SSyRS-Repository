Retail and Supply Chain Software System Requirements Scenario
1. System Overview
System Purpose:
The system is designed to optimize end-to-end supply chain operations for a multinational grocery retailer. It aims to improve demand forecasting accuracy, enhance supplier collaboration, and reduce lead times for replenishment to ensure fresh product availability while minimizing waste.

Domain/Context:
The system operates in the retail and supply chain domain, with a focus on perishable goods, requiring precise inventory management and just-in-time delivery processes.

Stakeholders:

Category Managers: Plan inventory levels and ensure product availability.
Supply Chain Managers: Oversee procurement, warehousing, and transportation.
Store Managers: Manage store-level stock and adjust orders based on local demand.
Suppliers: Collaborate on delivery schedules and quality assurance.
IT Teams: Manage system uptime, security, and integration.
User Base Characteristics:

Size: Approximately 6,000 users, including corporate staff, store employees, warehouse operators, and suppliers.
Diversity: Users range from in-store employees with limited technical expertise to highly specialized logistics planners.
Geographic Distribution: Operations span North America and Europe, with suppliers based in Asia, Africa, and South America.
Roles: Category managers, supply chain professionals, store personnel, and external suppliers.
Operational Environment:
The system is cloud-based and accessible via desktop, mobile, and IoT-enabled warehouse devices for real-time updates. The mobile app is used by store staff and delivery drivers, while the web portal is used by corporate teams and suppliers.

Usage Scenarios:

Store managers use the system to adjust orders dynamically based on sales trends and promotions.
Supply chain managers monitor shipment progress and respond to delays by reallocating inventory between distribution centers.
Suppliers receive automated forecasts and adjust production schedules accordingly.
Warehouse operators use the system to manage inbound and outbound shipments, reducing handling times.
2. Functional Requirements
Core Features:

AI-powered demand forecasting integrated with historical sales, weather data, and promotions.
Automated replenishment based on forecasted demand and predefined safety stock levels.
Integration with supplier systems for real-time order updates and delivery confirmations.
Warehouse management functionality, including slot optimization and real-time stock adjustments.
Analytics dashboards to provide insights on stock turnover, supplier performance, and operational efficiency.
Authentication Conditions & Frequency:

Users authenticate at the start of every session.
Re-authentication is required for sensitive actions, such as modifying procurement agreements or exporting operational data.
Sessions expire after 6 hours for regular users and 2 hours for administrators or users performing sensitive tasks.
Sensitivity of Actions & Permission Levels:

High Sensitivity: Adjusting procurement contracts, overriding AI-generated forecasts (Category Managers, IT Admins).
Medium Sensitivity: Adjusting store-level orders or rerouting shipments (Store Managers, Supply Chain Managers).
Low Sensitivity: Viewing stock levels or confirming delivery receipts (Warehouse Staff, Suppliers).
3. Non-Functional Requirements
Performance:

Core operations, such as inventory lookups or forecast adjustments, must respond within 2 seconds.
Support up to 25,000 concurrent users without significant performance degradation.
Scalability:

System must accommodate a 75% increase in data and users during peak periods, such as seasonal promotions or holidays.
Reliability:

Ensure 99.9% uptime with redundancy across regions.
Daily backups with an RTO of 2 hours and an RPO of 6 hours.
Security:

Role-based access control with least privilege principles.
Encryption for data at rest and in transit.
Usability:

User-friendly interface designed for minimal training (1-2 hours for operational users).
Accessibility compliance with WCAG 2.1 Level AA.
Audit & Monitoring:

Maintain detailed logs of user actions related to procurement, forecasting, and stock adjustments for 18 months.
Real-time alerts for suspicious access attempts or unauthorized changes.
4. Constraints
Technical Constraints:

Must integrate with legacy ERP systems and supplier APIs, requiring custom middleware development.
Warehouse operations rely on IoT devices with limited processing power.
Compliance Requirements:

GDPR compliance for European operations.
Adherence to food safety regulations for tracking and tracing perishable goods.
Resource Constraints:

Budget: $5.5 million allocated for design, development, testing, and deployment.
Staffing: A core team of 30, including developers, supply chain analysts, data scientists, QA specialists, and project managers.
Integration Needs:

Integrate with third-party logistics APIs for real-time shipment tracking.
Enable seamless data exchange with supplier and distributor systems for efficient collaboration.
This scenario balances realistic resource allocation, technical constraints, and functionality to address the challenges specific to retail and supply chain operations, particularly in managing perishable goods.
