Retail and Supply Chain Software System Requirements Scenario
1. System Overview
System Purpose:
The system aims to enable real-time demand forecasting, streamline order management, and improve supplier collaboration for a multinational retail chain. Its goals are to reduce lead times, enhance product availability, and optimize the supply chain to align with dynamic customer demands.

Domain/Context:
The system is designed for the retail and supply chain industry, focusing on a retail chain operating physical stores, regional distribution centers, and an international supplier network.

Stakeholders:

Retail Store Managers: Monitor sales trends and manage stock levels.
Supply Chain Coordinators: Oversee procurement and logistics workflows.
Warehouse Staff: Manage receiving, picking, and shipping operations.
Suppliers: Interact with the system for order updates and shipment coordination.
IT Administrators: Ensure system performance, security, and integrations.
User Base Characteristics:

Size: Approximately 5,000 users, including store employees, warehouse staff, supply chain specialists, and external suppliers.
Diversity: Ranges from low-technical-expertise warehouse workers to tech-savvy supply chain managers.
Geographic Distribution: Users span North America, Europe, and Asia.
Roles: Retail store staff, distribution center employees, logistics planners, procurement managers, and suppliers.
Operational Environment:
The system is hosted on a cloud-based infrastructure, with access via web portals and mobile apps. Mobile apps are primarily used by store and warehouse staff, while web access is preferred by corporate and supplier users.

Usage Scenarios:

Retail store managers generate automated stock replenishment orders based on AI-driven demand forecasts.
Warehouse staff use the system to view daily pick-and-pack lists optimized for shipment deadlines.
Suppliers update delivery schedules and confirm purchase orders through the portal.
Supply chain managers track order statuses, identify delays, and adjust procurement plans in real-time.
2. Functional Requirements
Core Features:

AI-driven demand forecasting with dynamic stock replenishment recommendations.
Integration with third-party logistics providers for real-time shipment tracking.
Supplier collaboration tools, including purchase order confirmations and delivery status updates.
Warehouse management tools for optimized picking, packing, and dispatching workflows.
Analytics dashboards providing insights into supply chain performance, sales trends, and inventory levels.
Authentication Conditions & Frequency:

Users authenticate at the start of each session.
Re-authentication is required for high-risk actions, such as modifying procurement contracts or exporting analytics data.
Sessions expire after 8 hours for operational users (e.g., warehouse staff) and 2 hours for administrators.
Sensitivity of Actions & Permission Levels:

High Sensitivity: Approving procurement contracts, adjusting supplier terms (Procurement Managers, IT Admins).
Medium Sensitivity: Modifying stock levels or adjusting forecasts (Store Managers, Supply Chain Coordinators).
Low Sensitivity: Viewing inventory or shipment status (Warehouse Staff, Suppliers).
3. Non-Functional Requirements
Performance:

System response times for core functionalities (e.g., stock lookup, order updates) must not exceed 3 seconds.
Support up to 20,000 concurrent users with no more than 10% performance degradation.
Scalability:

The system must handle up to a 50% increase in users and data during peak periods (e.g., holiday season).
Reliability:

Achieve 99.9% uptime with automated failover and disaster recovery mechanisms.
Backup data daily with a recovery time objective (RTO) of 2 hours and a recovery point objective (RPO) of 12 hours.
Security:

Role-based access control (RBAC) with granular permissions.
All data in transit and at rest must be encrypted using modern encryption standards.
Usability:

Intuitive interface with minimal training required, targeting a learning curve of 2-3 hours for new users.
Accessibility compliance with WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards to support diverse user needs.
Audit & Monitoring:

Log all user actions related to inventory adjustments, purchase order updates, and system configuration changes.
Maintain logs for a minimum of 18 months with real-time alerts for suspicious activity.
4. Constraints
Technical Constraints:

Must integrate seamlessly with the existing ERP system and regional POS systems for real-time data synchronization.
Limited bandwidth in rural distribution centers may affect real-time data synchronization speeds.
Compliance Requirements:

Must adhere to GDPR for data privacy across European operations.
Compliance with CCPA for California-based users and suppliers.
Resource Constraints:

Budget: $4 million allocated for design, development, testing, and deployment.
Staffing: Core team of 25, including developers, QA specialists, data scientists, supply chain consultants, and project managers.
Integration Needs:

Integrate with third-party logistics APIs for shipment tracking.
Interface with existing supplier portals to enable real-time order updates and confirmations.
This scenario aligns with industry challenges and goals, ensuring sufficient resources, realistic constraints, and robust system requirements for the retail and supply chain domain.
