Scenario: Smart Replenishment and Vendor Collaboration System
1. System Overview
System Purpose:
The system is designed to automate inventory replenishment and enhance vendor collaboration by using predictive analytics to forecast demand and ensure timely stock availability. It aims to minimize stockouts and overstock while streamlining communication between retailers and vendors.

Domain/Context:
The system operates within the retail and supply chain domain, focusing on medium-sized retailers with diverse product categories, including perishables, apparel, and electronics.

Stakeholders:

Retail Operations Managers: Oversee inventory and sales performance.
Category Managers: Manage product lines and vendor relations.
Suppliers/Vendors: Collaborate with retailers for order fulfillment and shipment tracking.
Store Associates: Use the system to verify inventory and address customer queries.
IT Administrators: Ensure system uptime, data security, and performance.
User Base Characteristics:

Size: Approximately 2,000 users, including 300 vendors and 1,700 retailer employees.
Diversity: Includes technical and non-technical users.
Geographic Distribution: Retailers and vendors are distributed across North America and Southeast Asia.
Roles: Operations managers, store associates, category managers, and external vendors.
Operational Environment:

The system is cloud-hosted with a mobile application for store-level operations.
Accessible via web interfaces for office users and APIs for vendor systems.
Usage Scenarios:

Category managers create automated replenishment rules based on historical data and seasonal trends.
Store associates verify incoming shipments using the mobile app's barcode scanning feature.
Vendors receive real-time alerts for low inventory thresholds and update shipment statuses.
2. Functional Requirements
Core Features:

Predictive analytics for demand forecasting using sales data, weather patterns, and seasonal trends.
Automated replenishment orders triggered by predefined thresholds.
Vendor collaboration portal for real-time communication and order tracking.
Mobile app for stock verification and product lookup.
Comprehensive reporting tools for inventory turnover and vendor performance metrics.
Notification system for anomalies such as delayed shipments or excessive stock levels.
Authentication Conditions & Frequency:

Users authenticate at the beginning of each session.
Re-authentication is required for sensitive actions, such as editing vendor agreements or adjusting replenishment rules.
Sessions expire after 45 minutes of inactivity.
Sensitivity of Actions & Permission Levels:

High Sensitivity: Approving replenishment orders above $100,000, editing vendor contracts (Category Managers only).
Medium Sensitivity: Adjusting stock thresholds or forecasting rules (Operations Managers).
Low Sensitivity: Viewing inventory reports or shipment statuses (Store Associates and Vendors).
3. Non-Functional Requirements
Performance:

Inventory updates and replenishment triggers must occur within 5 seconds of threshold breaches.
The system must support up to 5,000 concurrent users during peak operational hours.
Scalability:

Able to scale to include 500 vendors and support operations across 5,000 store locations.
Capable of handling 30% annual growth in transaction volume.
Reliability:

99.95% uptime SLA with built-in redundancy for critical modules.
Recovery mechanisms must restore operations within 1 hour of a critical failure.
Security:

Data encryption for all stored and transmitted information.
Role-based access controls with configurable permissions for external vendors.
Usability:

Intuitive UI with drag-and-drop rule-building for replenishment workflows.
Multilingual support for English, Spanish, Mandarin, and Tagalog.
Audit & Monitoring:

Track all replenishment rule changes, vendor communications, and high-value transactions.
Generate weekly audit logs for compliance and managerial review.
4. Constraints
Technical Constraints:

The system must integrate with existing ERP platforms (e.g., Microsoft Dynamics) and vendor management systems via APIs.
Mobile application compatibility is limited to Android 11+ and iOS 14+.
Compliance Requirements:

GDPR compliance for European vendors and customers.
Adherence to regional tax and invoicing standards in Southeast Asia.
Resource Constraints:

Budget: $7 million over 30 months.
Team: 40 members, including developers, data scientists, QA engineers, and project managers.
Time: MVP delivery in 15 months, with full implementation in 30 months.
Integration Needs:

The system must support seamless data exchange with vendor platforms for shipment tracking and invoicing.
Integration with weather and market trend APIs for enhanced demand forecasting.
This scenario balances ambitious objectives with conservative resource estimates, ensuring feasibility while addressing complex industry challenges.
