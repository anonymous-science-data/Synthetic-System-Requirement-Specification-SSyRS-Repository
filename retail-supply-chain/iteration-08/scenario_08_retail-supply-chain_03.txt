The system operates within the retail and supply chain domain, catering to medium-to-large grocery retailers and department stores managing high-demand seasonal or perishable products.

Stakeholders:

Pricing Analysts: Optimize pricing strategies based on market and demand data.
Supply Chain Managers: Ensure product availability and streamline supplier coordination.
Store Managers: Monitor and respond to local inventory and sales trends.
IT Administrators: Maintain system reliability and manage integrations.
Customers: Indirect stakeholders benefiting from competitive prices and product availability.
User Base Characteristics:

Size: Approximately 2,500 users across 150 retail stores and regional offices.
Diversity: Users range from pricing analysts and store managers to supply chain professionals with varying technical skills.
Geographic Distribution: North America and select European markets.
Roles: Pricing analysts, store managers, supply chain coordinators, IT teams.
Operational Environment:

The system is hosted on a hybrid infrastructure, leveraging cloud services for scalability and an on-premise component for localized pricing calculations at stores.
Accessible via desktop applications for analysts and mobile applications for store managers.
Usage Scenarios:

Pricing analysts set and monitor dynamic pricing rules for products, which automatically adjust based on demand and inventory.
Store managers receive alerts when specific items require promotion to clear overstock.
Supply chain managers use real-time inventory data to adjust supplier orders and distribution schedules.
2. Functional Requirements
Core Features:

Real-time dynamic pricing engine that adjusts product prices based on predefined rules and market conditions.
Integration with point-of-sale (POS) systems to ensure pricing consistency across online and offline channels.

Supplier management dashboard for tracking shipments and adjusting orders.
Mobile app for store managers to review pricing updates and inventory alerts.
Reporting tools for analyzing pricing performance, sales trends, and stock movements.
Authentication Conditions & Frequency:

Users authenticate at the start of each session.
Re-authentication is required for sensitive operations such as modifying pricing algorithms or supplier agreements.
Sessions expire after 30 minutes of inactivity.
Sensitivity of Actions & Permission Levels:

High Sensitivity: Modifying pricing algorithms or adjusting supplier contracts (Pricing Analysts and Managers).
Medium Sensitivity: Adjusting promotional campaigns or ordering extra stock (Store Managers and Supply Chain Managers).
Low Sensitivity: Viewing reports or tracking inventory (Analysts and IT Administrators).
3. Non-Functional Requirements

Compliance Requirements:

GDPR compliance for European operations, ensuring customer data privacy.
Compliance with regional tax laws for dynamic pricing adjustments.
Resource Constraints:

Budget: $10 million over 36 months.
Team: 50 members, including developers, data scientists, QA engineers, and project managers.
Time: MVP delivery in 18 months, full deployment in 36 months.
Integration Needs:

Seamless integration with supplier platforms and third-party pricing engines.
API support for real-time data exchange with marketing and customer loyalty systems.
This scenario provides a comprehensive and realistic depiction of a system focused on dynamic pricing and supply chain coordination, with resource allocations and timelines designed to handle industry-specific challenges.
