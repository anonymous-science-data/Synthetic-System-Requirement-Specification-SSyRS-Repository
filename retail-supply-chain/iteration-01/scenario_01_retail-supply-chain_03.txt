Retail and Supply-Chain System Scenario
1. System Overview
System Purpose:
The system is designed to optimize and unify retail and supply-chain operations by integrating demand forecasting, inventory tracking, order management, and logistics coordination. The primary goal is to minimize waste, reduce costs, and ensure on-time delivery for improved customer satisfaction.

Domain/Context:
The system operates in the retail and supply-chain industry, serving physical retail outlets, e-commerce platforms, and logistics networks.

Stakeholders:

Retail store managers and operational staff.
Logistics and supply-chain managers.
Suppliers and manufacturers.
Customers purchasing goods.
Business analysts and executives monitoring performance.
User Base Characteristics:

Size: Large-scale enterprises with thousands of users, including external suppliers and logistics partners.
Diversity: Users range from technical experts (data analysts) to non-technical staff (warehouse operators).
Geographic Distribution: Globally distributed operations spanning warehouses, retail locations, and regional offices.
Roles: System administrators, warehouse staff, suppliers, delivery partners, and customers.
2. Functional Requirements
Core Features:

Inventory Management: Real-time stock level updates, predictive restocking alerts, and automated order generation.
Demand Forecasting: AI-powered analytics for predicting sales trends and optimizing stock levels.
Order Management: Comprehensive tracking of customer orders from placement to delivery.
Vendor Collaboration: Supplier portals for managing purchase orders and shipments.
Returns Processing: Streamlined workflow for managing product returns and refunds.
Performance Dashboards: Centralized dashboards for visualizing key metrics and operational data.
Frequency of Authentication:

Warehouse operators: Once per session or shift.
Retail managers and admins: Per session, with additional authentication for sensitive operations like financial approvals.
Suppliers and delivery partners: Per session with two-factor authentication for updating contracts or shipment details.
Sensitivity of Actions:

High Sensitivity: Financial transactions, user role management, contract updates.
Medium Sensitivity: Inventory adjustments, demand forecasting data access.
Low Sensitivity: Viewing operational dashboards and non-critical data.
3. Non-Functional Requirements
Performance:

System response time: <2 seconds for key operations.
Capable of processing 10 million transactions daily during peak periods.
Scalability:

Supports a 300% increase in user activity during seasonal sales events.
Dynamic allocation of server resources to handle traffic spikes.
Reliability:

99.99% uptime with proactive monitoring and automated failover mechanisms.
Daily backups and rapid recovery solutions for disaster scenarios.
Security:

Data encryption at rest and in transit.
Role-based access control with multi-factor authentication for sensitive operations.
Compliance with GDPR and PCI-DSS standards for data protection and payment security.
Usability:

Intuitive interfaces for diverse users, including mobile app support for on-the-go access.
Multilingual support for global operations.
Accessibility features for users with disabilities.
4. Constraints
Technical Constraints:

Integration with legacy systems used in older warehouses and retail outlets.
Dependence on cloud infrastructure with edge computing capabilities for remote operations.
Compliance Requirements:

Adherence to GDPR for handling customer data.
PCI-DSS compliance for secure payment processing.
ISO 28000 compliance for supply-chain security management.
Resource Constraints:

Fixed budget for the first phase of implementation, requiring prioritization of core features.
Limited availability of in-house technical staff for maintenance and development.
Six-month deadline for rolling out the minimum viable product (MVP).
Integration Needs:

Seamless integration with existing authentication systems (e.g., SSO for corporate users).
APIs for connecting with third-party logistics and e-commerce platforms.
Compatibility with IoT devices like RFID scanners and barcode readers.
This scenario reflects a comprehensive and realistic vision for a retail and supply-chain management system, addressing functional and non-functional requirements alongside real-world constraints.
