Retail and Supply-Chain System Scenario
1. System Overview
System Purpose:
The system is designed to streamline the inventory allocation and distribution processes for a regional fashion retail chain. It aims to provide dynamic inventory optimization across stores, improve order fulfillment accuracy, and ensure smooth integration with suppliers for timely replenishment.

Domain/Context:
Retail and supply-chain management for fashion and apparel, with a focus on supporting seasonal trends, regional variations, and fast-moving consumer preferences.

Stakeholders:

Store managers: Track and manage inventory levels at the store level.
Supply-chain managers: Plan and execute inventory transfers between stores and distribution centers.
E-commerce managers: Ensure synchronization of stock levels between online platforms and physical stores.
Suppliers: Receive automated purchase orders and provide updates on shipments.
IT administrators: Maintain system operations and ensure data consistency.
User Base Characteristics:
The system supports approximately 600 users, including employees from 80 stores, 3 regional distribution centers, and a centralized corporate office. Suppliers, numbering around 50, will access the system through a secure portal for order management.

Operational Environment:
The system will be cloud-hosted, with mobile and desktop interfaces for employees and an API for integration with third-party logistics providers. The system will operate 24/7 to accommodate e-commerce operations and international supplier schedules.

Usage Scenarios:

Store managers view inventory dashboards and request transfers from nearby locations.
Supply-chain managers use forecasting tools to allocate inventory across the network based on sales trends.
E-commerce managers validate inventory levels before launching promotional campaigns.
Suppliers confirm receipt of purchase orders and provide estimated delivery dates through the portal.
2. Functional Requirements
Core Features:

Real-time inventory tracking across stores, warehouses, and e-commerce platforms.
Automated allocation of inventory based on regional sales trends and predefined thresholds.
Supplier portal for managing purchase orders and providing shipment updates.
Order management tools to facilitate store-to-store transfers and e-commerce order fulfillment.
Analytics and reporting for sales trends, stock turnover, and replenishment performance.
Authentication Conditions & Frequency:

Users authenticate once per session, with sessions expiring after 6 hours of inactivity.
Re-authentication is required for high-sensitivity actions such as manual overrides of automated inventory allocations, altering system configuration settings, or approving high-value supplier contracts.
Sensitivity of Actions & Permission Levels:

Inventory adjustments: Available to store managers and supply-chain planners, with audit logging.
Supplier contract updates: Restricted to procurement managers.
System configuration changes: Limited to IT administrators.
Approval of high-value purchase orders: Requires dual authentication from procurement managers and finance executives.
3. Non-Functional Requirements
Performance:

Inventory updates must propagate across all systems within 2 seconds.
Automated allocation processes must complete recalculation within 10 seconds of input data changes.
Scalability:

Handle up to 3,000 concurrent users during peak sales events.
Support data growth of 15% annually over five years without performance degradation.
Reliability:

99.9% uptime SLA, with an RTO of 15 minutes and RPO of 5 minutes for critical services.
Security:

Role-based access control (RBAC) with data encryption both in transit and at rest.
Regular vulnerability assessments and quarterly penetration testing.
Usability:

Provide an intuitive user interface tailored for store-level and distribution-level operations.
Support multiple languages to accommodate a diverse workforce.
Audit & Monitoring:

Log all user actions affecting inventory, orders, and supplier contracts.
Generate weekly audit reports for inventory adjustments and purchase approvals.
4. Constraints
Technical Constraints:

Must integrate with the company's existing ERP system and e-commerce platforms.
The system must leverage cloud infrastructure certified for GDPR compliance.
Compliance Requirements:

Adhere to GDPR for customer and transaction data collected via e-commerce.
Ensure compliance with trade regulations for international supplier transactions.
Resource Constraints:

Project budget capped at $2.8 million, with a development timeline of 14 months.
A cross-functional development team of 18 members, including business analysts, developers, and QA testers.
Integration Needs:

Seamless API-based integration with third-party logistics systems for real-time shipment tracking.
Compatibility with existing warehouse management systems (WMS) to streamline inventory updates.
This scenario aligns with the unique challenges of the retail and supply-chain domain, ensuring a balanced consideration of functional and non-functional requirements alongside realistic constraints.
