Retail and Supply-Chain System Scenario
1. System Overview
System Purpose:
The system aims to provide seamless inventory synchronization and order fulfillment management across a fast-growing grocery chain with physical stores and an online delivery platform. It will enable real-time inventory tracking, order management, and supplier collaboration to reduce spoilage and improve order accuracy.

Domain/Context:
Retail and supply-chain management for perishable goods in the grocery industry. The system supports operations across physical stores, online sales, and centralized distribution centers.

Stakeholders:

Store managers: Monitor inventory levels and coordinate restocking efforts.
Distribution center staff: Manage incoming and outgoing shipments.
Online order managers: Oversee real-time order status and fulfillment processes.
Suppliers: Access the system to view orders and update delivery schedules.
IT administrators: Maintain the system's uptime and integrations.
User Base Characteristics:
The system will support 800 users, including store and distribution center employees, online order managers, and suppliers. Users are geographically dispersed across 100 store locations and 5 distribution centers. Supplier users are regional and limited in technical proficiency.

Operational Environment:
The system will be cloud-hosted with access via desktop, mobile, and tablet devices. APIs will facilitate integration with existing e-commerce and logistics systems. Continuous availability is required to support global operations.

Usage Scenarios:

Store managers use a mobile app to update stock levels and request urgent replenishment.
Distribution center staff coordinate shipments and track incoming supplier deliveries.
Online order managers monitor customer orders, validate availability, and communicate delays.
Suppliers confirm delivery schedules and notify stores about potential delays or shortages.
2. Functional Requirements
Core Features:

Real-time inventory visibility at the store, distribution center, and system-wide levels.
Automated replenishment orders triggered by pre-set inventory thresholds.
Order management tools for online sales, including allocation of stock for pending orders.
Supplier portal for tracking order status and communication of delays or adjustments.
Dashboards and reporting for stock turnover, waste tracking, and order accuracy.
Authentication Conditions & Frequency:

Users authenticate once per session, with sessions expiring after 12 hours of inactivity.
Re-authentication is required for high-sensitivity actions such as overriding automated replenishment orders, modifying supplier contracts, or approving high-value purchases.
Sensitivity of Actions & Permission Levels:

Stock adjustments: Available to store and distribution managers with approval logging.
Replenishment overrides: Restricted to store managers and regional supervisors.
Supplier contract changes: Limited to procurement managers and executives.
System configurations (e.g., inventory thresholds): Limited to IT administrators.
3. Non-Functional Requirements
Performance:

Inventory updates must be reflected across the system within 3 seconds of a change.
Online order allocation processes must complete within 5 seconds per transaction.
Scalability:

Support up to 5,000 concurrent users during peak times such as holiday seasons or emergency stock runs.
Handle 10% year-over-year growth in data volume for a minimum of five years.
Reliability:

99.95% uptime SLA, with recovery time objectives (RTO) of under 30 minutes and recovery point objectives (RPO) of under 15 minutes.
Security:

Enforce role-based access control (RBAC) with encryption of all sensitive data in transit and at rest.
Annual third-party security audits and semi-annual penetration testing.
Usability:

Provide localized language support for all user-facing interfaces.
Ensure mobile-friendly UI for on-the-go inventory and order management.
Audit & Monitoring:

Log all user actions involving inventory changes, order overrides, and supplier updates.
Enable on-demand access to audit trails for compliance and operational review.
4. Constraints
Technical Constraints:

Must integrate seamlessly with existing e-commerce platforms and third-party logistics APIs.
Use a cloud provider certified for GDPR and regional compliance for data security and hosting.
Compliance Requirements:

Must comply with GDPR for customer data collected via online sales.
Adhere to local food safety regulations requiring traceability of perishable goods.
Resource Constraints:

Development budget capped at $3 million, with a project timeline of 18 months.
The development team includes 20 cross-functional members with varying expertise.
Integration Needs:

Integration with legacy ERP systems used by distribution centers.
APIs to connect with major logistics providers for tracking shipments in real-time.
This scenario balances the business goals, industry-specific challenges, and technical constraints, ensuring it aligns with the complexities of retail and supply-chain operations.
