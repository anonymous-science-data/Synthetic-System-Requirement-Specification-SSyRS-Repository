Retail and Supply-Chain System Scenario

1. System Overview
System Purpose:
The system aims to optimize the inventory management and replenishment processes for a mid-sized retail chain specializing in consumer electronics and appliances. It will provide real-time stock visibility, predictive demand analytics, and automated supplier ordering, reducing stockouts and overstock situations.

Domain/Context:
Retail and supply-chain management, focused on the consumer electronics segment. The system will support multi-channel retail operations, including brick-and-mortar stores, e-commerce platforms, and distribution centers.

Stakeholders:

Retail store managers: Monitor stock levels and trigger manual orders when needed.
Supply-chain planners: Use demand forecasting tools to optimize replenishment.
E-commerce managers: Ensure product availability aligns with online sales.
IT administrators: Maintain the system and ensure seamless integration with other platforms.
Suppliers: Receive automated purchase orders and provide delivery updates.
User Base Characteristics:
The system will serve approximately 500 users, including employees across 50 stores, a centralized warehouse, and regional supply-chain offices. These users vary in technical proficiency and geographic distribution. Suppliers, primarily regional, will access the system via a secure supplier portal.

Operational Environment:
The system will be cloud-based, accessible via desktop web browsers, mobile applications, and APIs for integration. It will support operations 24/7 to accommodate different time zones and dynamic e-commerce activity.

Usage Scenarios:

Store managers use a mobile app to check stock levels and request expedited orders.
Supply-chain planners review automated forecasts and adjust parameters for seasonal demand.
E-commerce managers validate inventory alignment with promotional campaigns.
Suppliers confirm and update order fulfillment statuses through the supplier portal.
2. Functional Requirements
Core Features:

Real-time inventory tracking across all locations.
Automated demand forecasting based on sales trends, seasonality, and external factors (e.g., market trends).
Supplier portal for purchase order receipt, acknowledgment, and delivery scheduling.
Alerts for stockouts, delayed shipments, and demand anomalies.
Integration with e-commerce platforms for live inventory updates.
Authentication Conditions & Frequency:

Users authenticate once per session, with sessions expiring after 8 hours of inactivity.
Re-authentication is required for sensitive actions such as modifying supplier payment details, adjusting demand forecasting parameters, or approving large purchase orders.
Sensitivity of Actions & Permission Levels:

Stock adjustments: Accessible by store managers and supply-chain planners with audit logging.
Forecasting overrides: Limited to supply-chain planners and supervisors.
Supplier payments: Restricted to financial administrators with dual-approval workflows.
API integrations: Limited to IT administrators with token-based authentication.
3. Non-Functional Requirements
Performance:

System must respond to 95% of user requests within 2 seconds.
Forecasting models must process updates within 10 minutes after new sales data is ingested.
Scalability:

Handle up to 1,000 concurrent users during peak promotional events.
Support data growth of 20% annually without performance degradation.
Reliability:

99.9% uptime, with automatic failover to a secondary region in case of outages.
Data recovery within 1 hour of system failure.
Security:

Role-based access control (RBAC) with data encryption at rest and in transit.
Annual penetration testing to identify vulnerabilities.
Usability:

Intuitive dashboards tailored for different user roles, with minimal training required.
Accessibility features (e.g., screen reader support, high-contrast modes).
Audit & Monitoring:

Log all user actions related to inventory adjustments, forecasting overrides, and purchase order approvals.
Generate monthly compliance reports for auditing purposes.
4. Constraints
Technical Constraints:

The system must integrate with existing ERP software (e.g., SAP or Oracle NetSuite).
Operate on a cloud platform certified for high availability, such as AWS or Azure.
Compliance Requirements:

Adhere to GDPR for handling customer data from online sales.
Ensure compliance with local tax and trade regulations in the regions where suppliers operate.
Resource Constraints:

Project budget capped at $2.5 million, with a 12-month development timeline.
A cross-functional team of 15 developers, analysts, and project managers available.
Integration Needs:

Seamlessly integrate with existing e-commerce platforms, point-of-sale (POS) systems, and third-party logistics providers for end-to-end supply-chain visibility.
This scenario captures a realistic challenge in the retail and supply-chain domain, balancing functional requirements, constraints, and business needs.
