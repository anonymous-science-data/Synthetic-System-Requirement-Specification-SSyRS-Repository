Retail and Supply Chain Software System Requirements Scenario
1. System Overview
System Purpose:
The system will streamline procurement and supplier collaboration for a regional grocery chain with multiple distribution centers. It focuses on automating purchase orders, managing supplier contracts, and tracking vendor performance. The goal is to reduce procurement cycle times, minimize overstock, and ensure consistent supply to stores.

Domain/Context:
The grocery retail sector with a focus on supplier management and inventory optimization across multiple distribution and retail locations.

Stakeholders:

Procurement managers.
Distribution center staff.
Suppliers and vendor account managers.
IT and operations teams.
User Base Characteristics:

Approximately 2,000 employees across 80 stores and 3 regional distribution centers.
Users range from procurement specialists to warehouse managers and store supervisors.
Suppliers, primarily regional vendors, use the system for order processing and status updates.
Operational Environment:

Hybrid cloud setup to ensure data availability and redundancy.
Accessible through desktop for internal users and mobile-friendly web portals for vendors.
Designed to operate in real-time to support dynamic procurement decisions.
Usage Scenarios:

Automated Order Generation: Procurement managers review system-generated purchase orders based on demand forecasts and send them to approved suppliers.
Vendor Collaboration Portal: Suppliers update order statuses, view delivery schedules, and upload invoices.
Vendor Performance Metrics: Procurement teams analyze supplier reliability using automated dashboards showing delivery times and order accuracy.
Stock Balancing: Distribution centers receive recommendations for reallocating stock between locations to meet shifting demand patterns.
2. Functional Requirements
Core Features:

Automated Procurement Workflow: Generate, approve, and send purchase orders based on forecasted demand and historical trends.
Supplier Portal: Allow vendors to confirm orders, report delays, and provide shipment tracking.
Performance Analysis: Monitor supplier KPIs, including on-time delivery and fill rates.
Real-Time Stock Recommendations: Alerts and tools for redistributing stock between locations.
Mobile Notifications: Alerts for order updates or issues requiring immediate attention.
Authentication Conditions & Frequency:

Internal users authenticate daily at login; sessions expire after 12 hours of inactivity.
Vendors authenticate at login, with re-authentication required for order submission or profile updates.
Re-authentication is required for procurement managers when approving purchase orders exceeding pre-set thresholds.
Sensitivity of Actions & Permission Levels:

High Sensitivity: Approving large purchase orders or modifying vendor contracts (restricted to procurement managers).
Medium Sensitivity: Viewing supplier performance metrics or editing order schedules (accessible to authorized users).
Low Sensitivity: Viewing stock reports or acknowledging system-generated alerts (accessible to general staff).
3. Non-Functional Requirements
Performance:

Must process up to 2,000 purchase orders per hour during peak operational periods.
Response times for stock and supplier queries must be under 1.5 seconds.
Scalability:

The system must scale to accommodate up to 50% more suppliers and double the current store count within five years.
Reliability:

99.9% uptime with disaster recovery procedures ensuring restoration within two hours.
Redundancy mechanisms to handle regional outages without affecting other locations.
Security:

Encryption of all supplier communications and sensitive data in transit and at rest.
Role-based access control (RBAC) to enforce permissions and minimize unauthorized access.
Usability:

Supplier portal must be accessible on mobile devices with intuitive interfaces requiring minimal training.
User interface for procurement managers must support advanced filtering and customizable dashboards.
Audit & Monitoring:

All purchase orders, supplier communications, and stock movements must be logged for audit trails.
Alerts for unusual patterns, such as unusually large orders or repeated supplier delays.
4. Constraints
Technical Constraints:

Must integrate with the chain's existing enterprise resource planning (ERP) system.
Limited network connectivity in some distribution centers necessitates offline capabilities for stock balancing.
Compliance Requirements:

Must comply with food safety and traceability regulations, such as FDA requirements in the U.S.
Adherence to regional tax and procurement laws for invoicing and reporting.
Resource Constraints:

Initial development budget of $8 million, with an annual maintenance budget of $1.5 million.
Dedicated implementation team of 20 developers, 5 business analysts, and 3 domain experts.
Integration Needs:

Integration with the existing inventory management system and supplier tracking tools.
Interfaces for importing data from third-party logistics providers for shipment tracking.
This scenario offers a unique perspective on retail and supply chain system challenges by focusing on procurement automation and supplier collaboration, ensuring realistic alignment with industry practices and constraints.
