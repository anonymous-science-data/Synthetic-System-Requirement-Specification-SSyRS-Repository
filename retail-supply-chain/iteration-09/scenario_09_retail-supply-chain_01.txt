Retail and Supply Chain Software System Requirements Scenario

1. System Overview
System Purpose:
The system aims to optimize inventory management and order fulfillment for a mid-sized retail chain with both physical stores and an online presence. It will provide real-time inventory visibility, demand forecasting, and seamless coordination between warehouses, suppliers, and retail outlets.

Domain/Context:
Retail and supply chain management with a focus on omnichannel operations, spanning both e-commerce and brick-and-mortar stores.

Stakeholders:
Retail store managers.
Warehouse staff and supervisors.
Supply chain analysts.
E-commerce managers.
Customers (indirect stakeholders).
User Base Characteristics:
Approximately 5,000 employees across 300 stores and 4 regional warehouses.
Users include retail associates, logistics teams, and supply chain planners distributed across North America.
Diverse technical proficiency, ranging from tech-savvy analysts to non-technical warehouse staff.
Operational Environment:
Cloud-hosted with web and mobile access.
Regional data centers for faster response times in geographically dispersed areas.
Designed to operate with intermittent connectivity in warehouses and stores, leveraging offline-first functionality.
Usage Scenarios:
Inventory Replenishment: A store associate scans a low-stock item, triggering an automated reorder to the nearest warehouse.
Order Fulfillment: An online order is routed to the most appropriate fulfillment center based on inventory levels and customer proximity.
Demand Forecasting: Supply chain analysts use dashboards to predict demand trends and adjust procurement schedules.
Returns Management: Returned items are scanned at retail locations, and the system determines whether to restock, return to the supplier, or flag for disposal.
2. Functional Requirements
Core Features:
Real-Time Inventory Tracking: Synchronization of inventory levels across stores, warehouses, and online platforms.
Order Management System: Workflow for processing orders, including splitting orders across multiple warehouses if necessary.
Demand Forecasting Tools: Machine learning models to predict seasonal or regional demand fluctuations.
Returns Processing: Streamlined workflows for inspecting and categorizing returned items.
Mobile App for Store Associates: Simplified interface for tasks like inventory scans, low-stock alerts, and customer order pickup.
Authentication Conditions & Frequency:
Users authenticate at the start of each work shift (session expiration after 8 hours of inactivity).
Sensitive actions (e.g., approving inter-warehouse transfers, modifying demand forecasts) require re-authentication.
Mobile app users authenticate once daily but must re-authenticate after switching devices or upon detection of significant location changes.
Sensitivity of Actions & Permission Levels:
High Sensitivity: Adjusting inventory levels or overriding automated order recommendations (restricted to managers).
Medium Sensitivity: Viewing demand forecasts or approving returns for restocking (restricted to authorized staff).
Low Sensitivity: Scanning inventory or picking orders (accessible to all associates).
3. Non-Functional Requirements
Performance:
Response time for inventory queries must not exceed 2 seconds under normal load.
Capable of processing up to 10,000 transactions per second during peak sales periods.
Scalability:
Horizontal scalability to support seasonal peaks, such as Black Friday and holiday sales.
Able to onboard up to 200 new stores over the next five years without major redesigns.
Reliability:
99.95% uptime SLA with automated failover mechanisms for critical services.
Error detection and recovery processes to handle network disruptions in warehouses.
Security:
Role-based access control (RBAC) to limit unauthorized actions.
Data encryption in transit and at rest.
Regular security audits and penetration testing.
Usability:
Multilingual interface support (English, Spanish, French).
Mobile app usability designed for quick learning and task completion with minimal training.
Audit & Monitoring:
Real-time logging of sensitive actions (e.g., inventory adjustments, approvals).
Dashboards for monitoring authentication trends and detecting anomalous behavior.
4. Constraints
Technical Constraints:
The system must operate on existing cloud infrastructure (AWS).
Limited connectivity in remote warehouse locations, requiring offline capabilities.
Compliance Requirements:
GDPR compliance for customer data in online orders.
Local regulatory requirements for supply chain traceability and product labeling.
Resource Constraints:
Initial development budget capped at $10 million.
Limited availability of supply chain domain experts for consultation during design phases.
Integration Needs:
Integration with the existing point-of-sale (POS) system and e-commerce platform.
Compatibility with supplier systems for automated order placement and tracking.
This scenario ensures comprehensive coverage of the challenges and opportunities in developing a modern retail and supply chain system while addressing realistic constraints and requirements.
