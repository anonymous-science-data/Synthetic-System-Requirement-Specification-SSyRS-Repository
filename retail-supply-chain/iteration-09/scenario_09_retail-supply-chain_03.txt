Retail and Supply Chain Software System Requirements Scenario
1. System Overview
System Purpose:
The system is designed to manage last-mile delivery operations for a large e-commerce retailer with a distributed network of regional hubs and third-party delivery partners. Its goal is to optimize delivery schedules, track shipments in real time, and improve customer satisfaction by reducing delivery times and ensuring transparency in the delivery process.

Domain/Context:
E-commerce logistics with a focus on last-mile delivery optimization and real-time shipment tracking.

Stakeholders:

Internal: Logistics managers, dispatch teams, and IT support staff.
External: Delivery drivers, third-party logistics (3PL) partners, and end customers receiving shipments.
User Base Characteristics:

Over 1,000 internal users, including logistics managers and dispatchers.
Approximately 10,000 third-party delivery drivers, geographically dispersed.
End customers, numbering in the millions, primarily interacting with tracking features.
Varied technical proficiency, with a focus on simple interfaces for external users.
Operational Environment:

Cloud-hosted with regional data centers to reduce latency and ensure data redundancy.
Access via desktop for dispatch teams, mobile apps for delivery drivers, and a web portal for customer tracking.
Designed to operate efficiently in low-connectivity areas for mobile app users.
Usage Scenarios:

Delivery Scheduling: Dispatch teams use the system to assign orders to available drivers based on proximity and capacity.
Real-Time Tracking: Customers receive updates on their delivery status, including estimated arrival times.
Route Optimization: Delivery drivers use the mobile app to follow dynamically optimized routes.
Issue Resolution: Logistics managers handle exceptions such as failed deliveries or delays via a dedicated dashboard.
2. Functional Requirements
Core Features:

Order Assignment: Automated assignment of orders to drivers based on predefined rules (e.g., location, availability).
Real-Time Tracking: GPS-based shipment tracking visible to dispatchers and customers.
Route Optimization: AI-driven algorithms to suggest optimal delivery routes, considering traffic and order priorities.
Delivery Confirmation: Drivers use the mobile app to upload proof of delivery (e.g., photos, signatures).
Exception Management: Tools for flagging and resolving failed deliveries or delays.
Authentication Conditions & Frequency:

Internal users authenticate daily at the start of their shift, with session expiration after 10 hours of inactivity.
Delivery drivers authenticate once per day but must re-authenticate if they log in from a new device.
Sensitive actions, such as reassigning orders or modifying routes, require re-authentication for logistics managers.
Sensitivity of Actions & Permission Levels:

High Sensitivity: Reassigning delivery routes or approving refunds (restricted to logistics managers).
Medium Sensitivity: Viewing delivery performance metrics (restricted to dispatch teams).
Low Sensitivity: Uploading proof of delivery or acknowledging route changes (accessible to drivers).
3. Non-Functional Requirements
Performance:

The system must support up to 50,000 simultaneous active users during peak hours.
Response times for route calculations must not exceed 3 seconds.
Scalability:

The system must scale to accommodate a 200% increase in daily deliveries over the next five years.
Reliability:

99.95% uptime with automated failover mechanisms to handle regional data center outages.
Data synchronization for delivery updates must occur within 5 seconds.
Security:

GPS data and delivery details must be encrypted in transit and at rest.
Role-based access control (RBAC) to limit unauthorized access to sensitive features.
Usability:

Driver mobile apps must support offline functionality for areas with poor connectivity.
Customer-facing tracking portals must offer an intuitive interface, requiring no training.
Audit & Monitoring:

All route changes, delivery exceptions, and system access events must be logged.
Monitoring tools must flag unusual patterns, such as repeated failed deliveries or unauthorized order modifications.
4. Constraints
Technical Constraints:

The system must integrate with the retailer's existing warehouse management and order processing systems.
GPS functionality must operate effectively with limited connectivity in rural and urban environments.
Compliance Requirements:

Compliance with GDPR for customer data privacy.
Adherence to local regulations for third-party logistics providers in each operational region.
Resource Constraints:

Development budget capped at $15 million, with an annual operational budget of $3 million.
Limited availability of AI specialists for route optimization model development.
Integration Needs:

Integration with third-party logistics partner APIs for real-time data sharing.
Compatibility with existing customer service tools to enable seamless issue resolution.
This scenario explores the challenges and solutions specific to last-mile delivery optimization, ensuring it remains distinct and focused on a critical area within the retail and supply chain domain.
