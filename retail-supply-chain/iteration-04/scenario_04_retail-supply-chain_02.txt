Retail and Supply-Chain Scenario: Centralized Vendor Collaboration Portal
1. System Overview
System Purpose:
The system is designed to centralize vendor collaboration and streamline the procurement process for a large retail chain with multiple distribution centers and stores. Its main objectives are to improve communication with suppliers, enhance order accuracy, and reduce delays in the supply chain through automated workflows and shared data visibility.

Domain/Context:
Retail and supply chain management, focusing on procurement and supplier relationship management for retail operations with a strong emphasis on sustainability and compliance.

Stakeholders:

Procurement Teams: Responsible for managing vendor relationships and negotiating contracts.
Suppliers/Vendors: Use the portal to view purchase orders, upload invoices, and track payments.
Store Managers: Monitor the status of incoming shipments and provide feedback on order accuracy.
Supply Chain Analysts: Analyze vendor performance and procurement trends.
IT Administrators: Maintain the system, including integrations and user access.
User Base Characteristics:

Size: Approximately 5,000 active users, including suppliers and internal staff.
Diversity: Users range from small-scale suppliers to large distributors with varying levels of technical sophistication.
Geographic Distribution: Suppliers are located globally, while retail and distribution center staff are spread across the chain's operational regions.
Roles: Include contract managers, procurement specialists, finance teams, and logistics coordinators.
2. Functional Requirements
Core Features:

Centralized dashboard for suppliers to access order details, payment status, and compliance documents.
Automated workflows for purchase order approvals, dispute resolution, and order confirmations.
Real-time notifications for order updates, shipment tracking, and payment processing.
Reporting tools for supplier performance, lead times, and order accuracy.
Integration with the retailer's ERP system for seamless data exchange.
Frequency of Authentication:

Procurement staff authenticate once per session.
Suppliers authenticate per session or during sensitive actions, such as contract uploads or payment disputes.
Sensitivity of Actions:

High-sensitivity: Approving supplier contracts, modifying order quantities post-approval.
Medium-sensitivity: Uploading compliance documents, confirming receipt of goods.
Low-sensitivity: Viewing shipment status, generating standard reports.
3. Non-Functional Requirements
Performance:

Response time for most actions: <3 seconds.
System throughput: Capable of processing 100,000 transactions per day.
Scalability:

Handle a 20% year-on-year increase in suppliers and transaction volume.
Allow seamless onboarding of new supplier regions or categories without system downtime.
Reliability:

Ensure 99.95% uptime, with recovery mechanisms to handle server failures within 10 minutes.
Implement redundant data storage to prevent loss of critical procurement records.
Security:

Enforce multi-factor authentication (MFA) for sensitive actions.
Encrypt sensitive supplier and financial data using advanced encryption standards.
Regular security audits to identify and mitigate vulnerabilities.
Usability:

Provide a multilingual interface to accommodate global suppliers.
Offer video tutorials and an in-portal helpdesk for suppliers unfamiliar with the system.
4. Constraints
Technical Constraints:

Must operate on the company's existing cloud infrastructure (Azure).
Use a microservices architecture to support modular scalability.
Compliance Requirements:

Adhere to anti-corruption regulations (e.g., FCPA) and data protection laws (e.g., GDPR).
Ensure compliance with sustainability reporting standards for supplier transparency.
Resource Constraints:

Budget capped at $5 million for development and rollout.
Project timeline limited to 18 months to meet the company's annual vendor review cycle.
Integration Needs:

Seamless integration with the company's ERP system (Oracle) and third-party logistics providers.
Support API connections for supplier systems with varying levels of technological sophistication.
This scenario addresses the challenges and requirements of a centralized vendor collaboration portal, tailored for the retail and supply-chain domain. It considers the technical, functional, and operational intricacies of such systems.
