Retail and Supply-Chain Scenario: Inventory and Order Optimization System
1. System Overview
System Purpose:
The system is designed to optimize inventory levels and streamline order management processes for a mid-to-large-scale retail chain. Its primary goals are to minimize stockouts, reduce overstocking, and ensure timely replenishment by leveraging predictive analytics and real-time inventory tracking.

Domain/Context:
Retail and supply chain management, focusing on omnichannel operations that include physical stores, e-commerce platforms, and distribution centers.

Stakeholders:

Retail Store Managers: Use the system for real-time inventory updates and restocking alerts.
Supply Chain Managers: Monitor warehouse stock levels and optimize distribution schedules.
IT Administrators: Maintain the system's functionality and integrate it with other enterprise tools.
Customers: Indirect beneficiaries, experiencing better product availability and faster delivery times.
Executives: Analyze high-level performance metrics and cost savings generated by the system.
User Base Characteristics:

Size: Approximately 3,000 users, including store-level employees, regional managers, and supply chain operators.
Diversity: Users vary in technical expertise, from entry-level staff to advanced supply chain analysts.
Geographic Distribution: Spread across North America, with operations in urban and suburban regions.
Roles: Includes order planners, procurement teams, warehouse staff, and regional supervisors.
2. Functional Requirements
Core Features:

Real-time inventory tracking with automated stock level updates.
Predictive analytics for demand forecasting based on historical data and seasonal trends.
Order automation, including low-stock alerts and suggested replenishment quantities.
Integration with supplier systems to streamline purchase order creation and tracking.
Role-specific dashboards and reporting tools for inventory, sales, and fulfillment metrics.
Frequency of Authentication:

Store employees authenticate once per shift.
Supply chain managers authenticate per session or before initiating sensitive actions, such as editing supplier contracts or modifying warehouse schedules.
Sensitivity of Actions:

High-sensitivity: Manual overrides of automated replenishment, access to supplier pricing information.
Medium-sensitivity: Generating inventory forecasts, editing product categories.
Low-sensitivity: Viewing stock levels, generating standard reports.
3. Non-Functional Requirements
Performance:

Average system response time: <2 seconds for most actions.
Support up to 10,000 concurrent users during peak times (e.g., holiday seasons).
Scalability:

Handle a 30% annual growth in transaction volume without performance degradation.
Easily onboard new stores and distribution centers with minimal configuration.
Reliability:

Ensure 99.9% uptime with automatic failover for critical services.
Implement comprehensive error logging and real-time alerts for system issues.
Security:

Enforce role-based access control (RBAC) for sensitive data and actions.
Encrypt all data in transit and at rest using industry-standard protocols.
Usability:

Provide multilingual support for employees with diverse linguistic backgrounds.
Ensure mobile compatibility for on-the-go inventory checks and approvals.
4. Constraints
Technical Constraints:

Operate on existing cloud infrastructure (AWS).
Use a pre-approved enterprise database solution (e.g., PostgreSQL).
Compliance Requirements:

Adhere to regional data protection laws (e.g., GDPR for EU-based operations).
Comply with financial reporting standards for inventory valuation.
Resource Constraints:

Project budget capped at $3 million for initial development and implementation.
Limited availability of in-house IT staff for development; reliance on external vendors for key components.
Integration Needs:

Seamlessly integrate with existing ERP systems (e.g., SAP) and e-commerce platforms (e.g., Shopify).
Use APIs to connect with third-party logistics providers for shipment tracking.
This scenario represents a realistic example of challenges and requirements faced in designing retail and supply-chain systems.
