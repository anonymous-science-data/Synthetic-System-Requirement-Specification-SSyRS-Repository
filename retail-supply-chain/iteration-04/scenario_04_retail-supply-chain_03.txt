Retail and Supply-Chain Scenario: Demand-Driven Inventory Management System
1. System Overview
System Purpose:
The system is designed to optimize inventory management by leveraging demand-driven analytics and real-time sales data. Its primary goals are to reduce waste, improve stock availability, and support dynamic replenishment across a network of stores and distribution centers.

Domain/Context:
Retail and supply chain management, with a focus on inventory optimization and efficient replenishment processes for a mid-sized grocery and general merchandise chain.

Stakeholders:

Inventory Managers: Oversee stock levels and replenishment strategies.
Store Managers: Monitor inventory and ensure shelf availability for high-demand products.
Suppliers: Access demand forecasts and receive automated purchase orders.
Data Analysts: Analyze sales trends and forecast demand for strategic decision-making.
IT Teams: Maintain system uptime, integrations, and data security.
User Base Characteristics:

Size: Approximately 2,000 users, including internal staff and external suppliers.
Diversity: Users include technical and non-technical roles with varying levels of access.
Geographic Distribution: Spanning urban and suburban store locations across three countries.
Roles: Includes store personnel, supply chain operators, and external suppliers.
2. Functional Requirements
Core Features:

Real-time integration with point-of-sale (POS) systems to collect sales data.
Predictive analytics to forecast demand based on sales trends, seasonality, and regional preferences.
Automated replenishment alerts and purchase order generation for low-stock items.
Dashboards and reports for inventory trends, stockouts, and waste metrics.
Integration with warehouse management systems (WMS) for coordinated replenishment and delivery.
Frequency of Authentication:

Internal users authenticate once per session or for sensitive actions.
External suppliers authenticate per session to access purchase orders and upload shipping information.
Sensitivity of Actions:

High-sensitivity: Approving bulk purchase orders, modifying demand forecasts.
Medium-sensitivity: Editing inventory thresholds, managing supplier profiles.
Low-sensitivity: Viewing sales trends, generating performance reports.
3. Non-Functional Requirements
Performance:

System response time: <2 seconds for dashboard refreshes and low-priority actions.
Support 5,000 concurrent users during seasonal peaks.
Scalability:

Handle a 25% increase in transaction volume year-over-year.
Support adding new store locations with minimal configuration.
Reliability:

Ensure 99.9% uptime, with failover mechanisms to minimize downtime.
Real-time backup and recovery processes for all inventory data.
Security:

Implement multi-layered security, including role-based access control (RBAC) and MFA.
Encrypt all data transfers and storage using modern encryption protocols.
Usability:

Provide an intuitive interface with localized language support for the three operating regions.
Offer training modules and a comprehensive user guide for new employees and suppliers.
4. Constraints
Technical Constraints:

Must operate on the company's hybrid cloud infrastructure using AWS and on-premise servers.
Leverage existing ERP and POS systems for seamless integration.
Compliance Requirements:

Comply with local and international data privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA).
Adhere to food safety inventory tracking laws for grocery items.
Resource Constraints:

Development budget capped at $4 million, with ongoing operational expenses included.
Limited in-house IT staff; key development outsourced to a trusted vendor.
Integration Needs:

Seamlessly integrate with POS, ERP, and WMS platforms.
API support for third-party vendor systems to synchronize delivery schedules and inventory updates.
This scenario reflects the challenges and requirements of a demand-driven inventory management system, tailored for the retail and supply-chain domain. It incorporates realistic goals and constraints to align with industry standards and operational needs.
