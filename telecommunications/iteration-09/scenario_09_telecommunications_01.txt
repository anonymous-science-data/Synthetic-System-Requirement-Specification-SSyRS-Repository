Telecommunications Software System Scenario
1. System Overview
System Purpose:
The system is a centralized network configuration and monitoring platform designed for telecommunications service providers. It aims to optimize network performance, automate routine maintenance tasks, and provide real-time visibility into network health and usage trends. This system also supports dynamic resource allocation to respond to fluctuating user demands, improving service reliability and efficiency.

Domain/Context:
The system operates in the telecommunications sector, specifically for managing and monitoring broadband, cellular, and enterprise communication networks.

Stakeholders:

Network Operations Teams: Responsible for day-to-day network management.
Field Technicians: Use the system to troubleshoot and resolve on-site issues.
Business Managers: Leverage analytics for decision-making and performance evaluation.
Customers: Indirect stakeholders benefiting from improved service reliability and faster issue resolution.
User Base Characteristics:

Size: Approximately 5,000 users globally.
Diversity: Includes technical staff, business users, and field workers with varying expertise levels.
Geographic Distribution: Users operate in multiple regions, spanning North America, Europe, and Asia-Pacific.
Roles: Administrators, analysts, technicians, and executive users.
Operational Environment:
The system is hosted on a hybrid infrastructure combining a cloud-based platform with on-premise edge components to support low-latency operations in regional data centers. It is accessible via web and mobile interfaces.

Usage Scenarios:

A network operations analyst monitors real-time traffic and receives alerts for unusual activity.
A field technician accesses equipment diagnostics and configuration details on-site using a mobile app.
A business manager generates a report on service performance metrics for the previous quarter.
2. Functional Requirements
Core Features:

Real-Time Network Monitoring: Display traffic, usage patterns, and potential bottlenecks.
Automated Configuration Management: Apply bulk updates to network devices.
Incident Management: Automatically detect issues, create tickets, and suggest resolutions.
Resource Optimization: Reallocate bandwidth dynamically based on real-time demand.
Analytics & Reporting: Provide insights on usage, service quality, and operational efficiency.
Authentication Conditions & Frequency:

Session Expiration: Users must re-authenticate after 8 hours of inactivity.
Sensitive Actions: Re-authentication is required when accessing or modifying critical network configurations or exporting large datasets.
Sensitivity of Actions & Permission Levels:

High Sensitivity: Device configurations and bandwidth reallocation require administrator-level permissions.
Moderate Sensitivity: Viewing detailed analytics is restricted to business managers and analysts.
Low Sensitivity: Monitoring dashboards are accessible to all technical staff.
3. Non-Functional Requirements
Performance:

Dashboard response time must not exceed 2 seconds under normal load.
The system should support up to 1 million concurrent network data events per second.
Scalability:

Must handle a 50% increase in users or data load during peak periods, such as holidays or emergencies.
Reliability:

99.99% uptime SLA with automated failover mechanisms and backup recovery within 15 minutes.
Security:

Role-based access control (RBAC) must ensure no unauthorized access to critical operations.
End-to-end encryption for all data in transit and at rest.
Usability:

Intuitive interfaces for technical and non-technical users, with role-specific dashboards.
Support for multiple languages, including English, Spanish, and Mandarin.
Audit & Monitoring:

Comprehensive logging of all user actions, with 6 months of log retention.
Real-time notifications for unusual authentication patterns or failed login attempts.
4. Constraints
Technical Constraints:

The system must operate seamlessly with existing telecom hardware and network protocols.
Limited availability of low-latency edge servers in certain remote regions.
Compliance Requirements:

Must adhere to GDPR for European users and CCPA for California-based users.
Compliance with ISO 27001 for information security management.
Resource Constraints:

Initial budget of $12 million for system development and deployment.
Team allocation: 50 developers, 10 security specialists, and 20 operations staff.
Integration Needs:

Integration with legacy OSS (Operational Support Systems) and BSS (Business Support Systems).
API support for third-party ticketing and analytics platforms.
