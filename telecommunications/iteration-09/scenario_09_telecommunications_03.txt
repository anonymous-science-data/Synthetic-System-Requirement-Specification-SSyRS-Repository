Telecommunications Software System Scenario
1. System Overview
System Purpose:
The system is a next-generation network capacity planning and optimization platform for telecommunications service providers. It aims to forecast and manage network capacity requirements in real-time, ensuring optimal performance during peak usage periods while minimizing operational costs. The system leverages AI-driven analytics to predict network demand and allocate resources dynamically.

Domain/Context:
The system operates in the telecommunications sector, focusing on network management and capacity planning for broadband, mobile, and enterprise networks.

Stakeholders:

Network Operations Teams: Use the system to monitor and adjust network capacity in real-time.
Business Strategy Teams: Use forecasting insights to plan infrastructure investments.
Field Engineers: Deploy hardware upgrades based on the system's recommendations.
Executive Leadership: Monitor high-level metrics for decision-making and budgeting.
User Base Characteristics:

Size: Approximately 1,500 users across various departments.
Diversity: Includes technical, strategic, and executive-level personnel.
Geographic Distribution: Users span urban and rural regions globally, emphasizing connectivity in underserved areas.
Roles: Network administrators, engineers, business analysts, and executives.
Operational Environment:
The system is deployed as a cloud-based solution with regional edge servers to process real-time network data locally. Access is available through a web-based interface and mobile application, ensuring availability for on-site users.

Usage Scenarios:

A network administrator monitors a sudden surge in mobile traffic and reallocates bandwidth in real-time.
A business analyst uses forecasting tools to identify potential bottlenecks and proposes infrastructure upgrades.
A field engineer receives automated alerts to inspect and upgrade hardware in high-demand areas.
2. Functional Requirements
Core Features:

Demand Forecasting: AI-driven tools predict network demand based on historical and real-time data.
Dynamic Resource Allocation: Automatically reallocates bandwidth and processing power to high-demand areas.
Scenario Planning: Simulates "what-if" scenarios to assess the impact of various strategies.
Real-Time Alerts: Notifies users of impending capacity issues and suggests actions.
Integrated Reporting: Provides detailed analytics on network usage, capacity trends, and cost optimization.
Authentication Conditions & Frequency:

Session Expiration: Users are required to re-authenticate after 8 hours of inactivity.
Sensitive Actions: Re-authentication is mandatory for making manual adjustments to network configurations or exporting detailed forecasting data.
Sensitivity of Actions & Permission Levels:

High Sensitivity: Adjusting resource allocation manually or deploying a capacity upgrade requires administrator-level access.
Moderate Sensitivity: Generating and sharing detailed forecasts is limited to analysts and senior roles.
Low Sensitivity: Viewing real-time dashboards and alerts is available to all users.
3. Non-Functional Requirements
Performance:

System response times should not exceed 1.5 seconds for high-priority actions like bandwidth reallocation.
The platform must support up to 700,000 data events per second to accommodate peak traffic periods.
Scalability:

The system should scale to handle a 40% increase in data throughput over the next 3 years, ensuring uninterrupted service during demand spikes.
Reliability:

The system must achieve 99.98% uptime, with redundancy mechanisms and automated recovery within 15 minutes during failures.
Security:

All data must be encrypted during transmission and at rest.
Role-based access control (RBAC) ensures that only authorized users can perform critical actions.
Usability:

The interface should provide intuitive workflows, with customizable dashboards tailored to each user role.
Support for English, Spanish, and German is required to accommodate the global user base.
Audit & Monitoring:

All user actions, especially those involving resource allocation or data exports, must be logged and stored for 12 months.
Real-time monitoring should detect and flag unusual activity or system anomalies.
4. Constraints
Technical Constraints:

The system must integrate seamlessly with legacy network monitoring and management tools.
Limited high-speed internet connectivity in rural areas may impact edge server performance.
Compliance Requirements:

Must comply with GDPR for European users and ensure data residency in countries with strict localization laws.
Certification under ISO 27001 and ISO 20000 for information security and IT service management, respectively.
Resource Constraints:

Development budget of $15 million, with a $3 million annual maintenance allocation.
Project staffing includes 60 developers, 12 data scientists, and 20 operations engineers.
Integration Needs:

Integration with legacy OSS/BSS systems and APIs for external reporting and analytics tools.
