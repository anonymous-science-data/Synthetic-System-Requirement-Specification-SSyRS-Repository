Telecommunications System Requirements Scenario
1. System Overview
System Purpose:
The system is designed to provide centralized management and optimization of network resources for a mid-sized telecommunications provider. It aims to improve network performance, automate resource allocation, and enhance customer experience by offering self-service portals and efficient troubleshooting tools.

Domain/Context:
The telecommunications industry, specifically targeting network operations and customer-facing digital services.

Stakeholders:

Internal: Network operations teams, customer support representatives, and IT administrators.
External: Residential and business customers who use telecommunications services, including internet, voice, and video services.
Regulatory Bodies: Agencies ensuring compliance with telecommunications laws and data privacy regulations.
User Base Characteristics:

Size: Approximately 1,500 internal users and up to 200,000 active external users.
Diversity: Users range from highly technical engineers to non-technical customers.
Geographic Distribution: Internal users are primarily in the provider's operational hubs, while external users are spread across a multi-state region.
Roles: Internal users include administrators, engineers, and customer service agents. External users consist of customers managing their accounts and usage.
Operational Environment:

Hosting: The system is cloud-based with redundancy across multiple data centers for high availability.
Access: Available via web portals, mobile applications, and APIs for internal systems.
Usage Scenarios: Customers use the system to check service statuses, troubleshoot connectivity issues, or upgrade plans. Internal teams use it to allocate resources, monitor network performance, and respond to incidents.
2. Functional Requirements
Core Features:

Network Optimization: Automate bandwidth allocation based on demand patterns and service-level agreements (SLAs).
Customer Self-Service Portal: Enable users to view and pay bills, manage subscriptions, and report issues.
Incident Management: Provide tools for internal teams to identify, log, and resolve network issues efficiently.
Real-Time Monitoring: Dashboards displaying key performance indicators (KPIs) such as network latency and usage trends.
API for Integrations: Allow third-party systems to query network data and trigger operations.
Authentication Conditions & Frequency:

Session-Based: Authentication is required at the start of every session, with automatic expiration after 30 minutes of inactivity.
Sensitive Actions: Re-authentication is required for actions such as modifying user permissions, making large account payments, or provisioning network changes.
Sensitivity of Actions & Permission Levels:

Low Sensitivity: Viewing account details or network usage (Customer role).
Moderate Sensitivity: Submitting trouble tickets or adjusting subscriptions (Customer role with verification).
High Sensitivity: Modifying network configurations or managing SLAs (Administrator or Engineer role).
3. Non-Functional Requirements
Performance:

Ensure a response time under 2 seconds for 95% of user interactions.
Support concurrent usage by up to 10,000 users without performance degradation.
Scalability:

The system must scale to handle a 30% increase in active users annually over the next 5 years.
Accommodate bursts of up to 20% additional traffic during peak hours.
Reliability:

Achieve 99.9% uptime, with failover mechanisms in place for critical services.
Implement robust error logging and automatic retries for transient failures.
Security:

All data must be encrypted at rest and in transit.
Role-based access controls to restrict sensitive operations.
Usability:

Provide intuitive interfaces, with mobile apps optimized for Android and iOS.
Ensure accessibility compliance (e.g., WCAG 2.1 AA).
Audit & Monitoring:

Log all authentication events, network configuration changes, and customer transactions.
Generate weekly reports on usage trends and security incidents for internal review.
4. Constraints
Technical Constraints:

Must integrate with the existing OSS/BSS (Operational Support Systems/Business Support Systems).
Limited support for older customer devices using legacy web browsers.
Compliance Requirements:

Adhere to GDPR for data privacy and CCPA for customer transparency.
Follow industry standards such as ISO 27001 for information security management.
Resource Constraints:

Budget: $2 million allocated for development and initial deployment.
Team Size: 20 members, including developers, testers, and system architects.
Time Frame: 18 months from requirements gathering to system launch, with 3 months allocated for pilot testing.
Integration Needs:

Integrate seamlessly with existing customer authentication systems and network monitoring tools.
Provide APIs for external reporting systems used by regulatory agencies.
This scenario outlines a practical, conservative roadmap for a telecommunications system, aligning business goals with technical and operational feasibility.
