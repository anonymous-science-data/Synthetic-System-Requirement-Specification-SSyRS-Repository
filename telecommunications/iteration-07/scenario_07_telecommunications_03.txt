Telecommunications System Requirements Scenario
1. System Overview
System Purpose:
The system will serve as a unified digital platform for optimizing customer support, network operations, and service management for a national telecommunications provider. It aims to enhance service reliability, improve customer satisfaction, and reduce operational inefficiencies through automation and real-time analytics.

Domain/Context:
The telecommunications industry, with a focus on customer support automation, proactive network management, and compliance with regulatory standards.

Stakeholders:

Internal: Customer service agents, network engineers, and IT administrators.
External: Residential customers, small business owners, and field technicians.
Regulatory Bodies: Authorities overseeing telecommunications standards and data privacy compliance.
User Base Characteristics:

Size: Approximately 2,000 internal users and up to 500,000 external users.
Diversity: Internal users range from highly technical engineers to non-technical customer service agents. External users include individual consumers, small businesses, and regional technicians.
Geographic Distribution: Internal users are primarily located in regional hubs, while external users are widely distributed across urban and rural areas nationwide.
Roles: Customers use the platform for account management and troubleshooting; internal users include administrators, engineers, and customer service representatives.
Operational Environment:

Hosting: The system will be cloud-based with geographically distributed servers for low-latency performance and high availability.
Access: Available via a responsive web portal, dedicated mobile applications, and APIs for integration with third-party systems.
Usage Scenarios: Customers use the system for bill payment, troubleshooting, and upgrading services. Internal teams use it for monitoring network performance, responding to incidents, and managing customer accounts.
2. Functional Requirements
Core Features:

Customer Self-Service: Provides functionality for bill payment, troubleshooting, service upgrades, and account management.
Real-Time Network Monitoring: Displays network status, with alerts for outages or performance anomalies.
Automated Troubleshooting: Offers guided solutions for common issues, integrated with chatbots for customer support.
Proactive Maintenance Alerts: Notifies internal teams of predicted network failures or capacity issues based on analytics.
API Integrations: Supports third-party systems, such as billing platforms and regulatory compliance tools.
Authentication Conditions & Frequency:

Session-Based: Authentication is required at the beginning of each session, with automatic session expiration after 30 minutes of inactivity.
Sensitive Actions: Re-authentication is required for account modifications, service upgrades, or initiating large-scale network changes.
Sensitivity of Actions & Permission Levels:

Low Sensitivity: Viewing account details or general usage statistics (Customer role).
Moderate Sensitivity: Submitting troubleshooting tickets or upgrading service plans (Customer role with identity verification).
High Sensitivity: Managing network configurations, modifying user permissions, or accessing regulatory data (Administrator role).
3. Non-Functional Requirements
Performance:

The system should maintain a response time under 2 seconds for 90% of customer interactions.
Support simultaneous usage by up to 20,000 users during peak hours.
Scalability:

The platform must handle a 25% increase in users annually for the next 5 years.
Accommodate traffic spikes, such as during network outages or large-scale promotional campaigns.
Reliability:

Ensure 99.9% system uptime with failover mechanisms and real-time backups.
Implement automatic retries and detailed logging for error handling.
Security:

Encrypt all data at rest and in transit using industry-standard protocols.
Utilize role-based access controls with periodic audits for security compliance.
Usability:

Provide an intuitive interface with accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA).
Optimize the mobile application for iOS and Android with offline functionality for critical features.
Audit & Monitoring:

Maintain logs of all authentication events, sensitive actions, and system changes.
Provide real-time dashboards for internal auditing and compliance reporting.
4. Constraints
Technical Constraints:

The platform must integrate seamlessly with existing OSS/BSS systems.
Legacy customer devices, including older web browsers, must be supported.
Compliance Requirements:

Adhere to GDPR for customer data protection and CCPA for transparency in data usage.
Comply with national telecommunications regulations for data retention and operational standards.
Resource Constraints:

Budget: $4.5 million allocated for development, testing, and initial deployment.
Team Size: A dedicated team of 30 members, including developers, network specialists, compliance experts, and QA testers.
Time Frame: 30 months from initial requirements gathering to full deployment, including 6 months for pilot testing.
Integration Needs:

The system must integrate with external billing, monitoring, and regulatory reporting tools.
Provide APIs for external partners and field technicians to access relevant system data securely.
This scenario ensures that the system is realistic, scalable, and aligned with the telecommunications sector's operational and regulatory needs while accounting for potential complexities in deployment and ongoing operation.
