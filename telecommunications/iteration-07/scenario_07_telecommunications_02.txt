Telecommunications System Requirements Scenario
1. System Overview
System Purpose:
The system is designed to enhance customer experience and operational efficiency for a telecommunications company by implementing a unified service management platform. This platform will support customer self-service capabilities, network monitoring, and automated incident resolution, ensuring high service quality and customer satisfaction.

Domain/Context:
The telecommunications industry, with a focus on customer service, network optimization, and operational support.

Stakeholders:

Internal: Network engineers, customer service representatives, IT administrators, and product managers.
External: Residential and small business customers using voice, internet, and TV services.
Regulatory Bodies: Government and industry-specific organizations responsible for compliance and privacy standards.
User Base Characteristics:

Size: Around 1,000 internal users and 300,000 external customers.
Diversity: Internal users range from technical staff managing the network to non-technical employees handling customer inquiries. External users include individual consumers and small business owners.
Geographic Distribution: Internal users are centralized in regional hubs, while external users are distributed across several metropolitan and rural areas.
Roles: Roles include customers (end-users), administrators (internal), engineers, and regulators accessing system logs.
Operational Environment:

Hosting: The system is cloud-hosted with failover capabilities and localized data storage for compliance with regional data laws.
Access: Accessible through a web portal, mobile applications, and APIs.
Usage Scenarios:
Customers manage their subscriptions, troubleshoot service issues, and monitor usage.
Internal teams monitor network performance, resolve incidents, and optimize resource allocation.
2. Functional Requirements
Core Features:

Customer Self-Service Portal: Enables customers to update their accounts, pay bills, view service usage, and troubleshoot problems.
Network Performance Monitoring: Provides real-time dashboards with alerts for anomalies in network behavior.
Automated Incident Resolution: Uses machine learning to predict and resolve common network issues automatically.
Service Customization: Allows customers to upgrade or downgrade services with immediate provisioning.
API Access: Supports integrations with external billing systems and regulatory reporting tools.
Authentication Conditions & Frequency:

Session-Based: Authentication required at the start of each session; sessions expire after 20 minutes of inactivity.
Sensitive Actions: Re-authentication required for high-risk activities such as modifying customer plans, making significant account payments, or accessing restricted reports.
Sensitivity of Actions & Permission Levels:

Low Sensitivity: Viewing account details or service usage (Customer role).
Moderate Sensitivity: Reporting issues or upgrading services (Customer role with verification).
High Sensitivity: Accessing network configurations, system logs, or billing APIs (Administrator or Engineer roles).
3. Non-Functional Requirements
Performance:

System should maintain a response time under 3 seconds for 95% of requests.
Support simultaneous usage by 15,000 users during peak hours.
Scalability:

Scale to handle a 50% increase in users over the next 3 years, with a 10% yearly growth in data.
Accommodate sudden spikes in traffic, such as during service outages, with minimal performance degradation.
Reliability:

Ensure 99.95% system uptime with automated failover mechanisms.
Implement robust error handling and data recovery processes to minimize downtime.
Security:

Enforce data encryption both in transit and at rest.
Implement role-based access control with periodic access reviews.
Usability:

Provide a responsive design for web and mobile applications, with support for multiple languages and accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA).
Audit & Monitoring:

Log all authentication events, configuration changes, and API transactions.
Generate automated weekly compliance and usage reports for review by internal and external stakeholders.
4. Constraints
Technical Constraints:

The system must integrate with existing OSS/BSS solutions and adhere to legacy APIs for billing.
Support for customer devices running older versions of popular web browsers.
Compliance Requirements:

Meet GDPR and CCPA requirements for data privacy and customer rights.
Adhere to regional telecommunications regulations for data retention and security.
Resource Constraints:

Budget: $3.5 million allocated for development, deployment, and initial scaling.
Team Size: 25 members, including developers, testers, network specialists, and compliance officers.
Time Frame: 24 months from requirements gathering to system go-live, including 4 months for pilot testing.
Integration Needs:

Must integrate with existing customer authentication systems, network monitoring tools, and third-party billing platforms.
Provide APIs for external partners and regulatory bodies to access relevant data securely.
This scenario ensures alignment with telecommunications industry standards and practices while accounting for potential challenges, delays, and scalability requirements.
