1. System Overview
System Purpose:

Global Network Resource Allocation and Optimization System (GNRAOS): A system designed to dynamically allocate and optimize network resources for a multinational telecommunications provider. It focuses on managing capacity for high-demand scenarios, such as major events, disasters, or seasonal spikes, ensuring seamless service delivery and minimal downtime.
Domain/Context:

Telecommunications Network Resource Management: The system operates within the realm of global network infrastructure management, addressing the need for adaptive resource allocation across diverse geographic and regulatory landscapes.
Stakeholders:

    Network Planning Teams: Use the system for forecasting and allocating resources based on traffic patterns.
    Operations Teams: Monitor and adjust resource usage in real time during high-demand periods.
    Executives: Analyze resource allocation efficiency and network utilization for strategic decision-making.
    Third-Party Partners: Collaborate with the provider to manage capacity sharing agreements and compliance obligations.
    End-Users: Indirectly benefit from improved service reliability and reduced latency during high-demand events.

User Base Characteristics:

    Size: 8,000 internal users (including engineers, planners, and executives), and automated systems handling global operations across 50+ countries.
    Diversity: Users span technical and non-technical roles, with regional teams specialized in local regulations and customer needs.
    Geographic Distribution: Global, with emphasis on regions experiencing seasonal peaks (e.g., North America, Europe, and Southeast Asia).
    Roles: Engineers, planners, regional managers, executives, and compliance auditors.

Operational Environment:

    Hosting: Multi-cloud deployment with on-premise failover systems in critical regions.
    Access Modes: Web-based dashboards, mobile apps for regional managers, and API endpoints for automated resource adjustments.
    Usage Scenarios:
        Network planners preemptively allocate bandwidth for a global sporting event.
        Operations teams use real-time dashboards to reroute traffic during a network outage.
        Regional managers adjust capacity allocations to meet local regulatory requirements.
        Automated systems redistribute resources in response to sudden spikes in usage.

2. Functional Requirements
Core Features:

    Traffic Pattern Analysis: AI-driven tools to predict usage spikes based on historical data and external events.
    Dynamic Resource Allocation: Real-time adjustment of network capacity to optimize performance and reduce congestion.
    Regional Compliance Management: Tools to enforce resource allocation limits based on local regulations.
    Event-Specific Mode: Pre-configured templates for rapid deployment of resources during planned events or emergencies.
    API for External Tools: Allow third-party applications to integrate with resource allocation functions.
    Custom Alerts and Notifications: Notify teams of capacity issues or compliance violations in real time.

Authentication Conditions & Frequency:

    Session Expiration: Sessions automatically expire after 20 minutes of inactivity for internal users.
    Sensitive Actions: Resource allocation changes, compliance overrides, and API access requests require re-authentication.
    Geographic-Specific Access: Elevated authentication conditions when accessing regions outside a user's usual geographic scope.

Sensitivity of Actions & Permission Levels:

    High Sensitivity: Adjusting global capacity allocation or overriding compliance limits (restricted to senior engineers and executives).
    Moderate Sensitivity: Regional capacity adjustments and generating compliance reports (restricted to regional managers).
    Low Sensitivity: Viewing network utilization data and generating standard traffic reports (available to all relevant roles).

3. Non-Functional Requirements
Performance:

    Resource allocation adjustments must take effect within 30 seconds.
    Dashboards must display updates with sub-2-second response times for queries under normal load.

Scalability:

    Support up to 10,000 concurrent users across multiple regions.
    Handle 500,000 automated API calls per hour during high-demand events without degradation.

Reliability:

    99.99% uptime required, with failover to secondary systems in under 60 seconds during outages.
    Data redundancy across geographically distributed data centers.

Security:

    Encryption of all data in transit and at rest.
    Granular role-based access control for resource adjustment and reporting features.
    Geofencing to restrict access to sensitive data based on location.

Usability:

    Intuitive interface with role-specific dashboards and customizable visualizations.
    Mobile app optimized for quick access and decision-making in the field.

Audit & Monitoring:

    Comprehensive logging of all resource allocation changes and user activities.
    Automated compliance reports highlighting deviations from regional regulations.
    Real-time monitoring and alerting for anomalous activities.

4. Constraints
Technical Constraints:

    Integration with legacy traffic management systems in certain regions.
    Limited bandwidth availability in rural and underserved areas, requiring edge computing for local optimizations.

Compliance Requirements:

    Adherence to regional telecommunications laws, including GDPR, CCPA, and country-specific traffic management rules.
    Logging and audit capabilities to support regional audits and data privacy regulations.

Resource Constraints:

    Budget: $30 million over 3 years.
    Team: 100 staff, including developers, data scientists, and network engineers, with a dedicated compliance team of 10 members.
    Timeline: 36 months, with quarterly milestones and phased regional rollouts.

Integration Needs:

    APIs for integration with legacy network monitoring tools, regional compliance platforms, and traffic shaping systems.
    Compatibility with third-party analytics and capacity planning tools.
