1. System Overview
System Purpose:

The system, Unified Network Performance & Optimization Portal (UNPOP), is designed to provide real-time monitoring, predictive analytics, and optimization tools for a telecommunications provider managing a complex multi-country network infrastructure. The primary goal is to improve network performance, minimize downtime, and enhance the user experience for subscribers.
Domain/Context:

Telecommunications Network Management: The system operates in the domain of monitoring, maintaining, and optimizing large-scale telecommunication infrastructures, including 5G, fiber-optic, and legacy networks.
Stakeholders:

    Network Operations Center (NOC) Teams: Responsible for day-to-day network monitoring and issue resolution.
    Field Engineers: Use the system for diagnostics and targeted actions.
    Regional Managers: Use analytics for strategic decisions on network upgrades.
    Executive Leadership: Track high-level performance KPIs.
    Regulators: Access audit and compliance reports.

User Base Characteristics:

    Size: Approximately 10,000 active users, including employees and external contractors.
    Diversity: Users range from technical engineers to non-technical business leaders.
    Geographic Distribution: Spanning multiple countries in Europe, with varying regulatory and language requirements.
    Roles: NOC personnel, field engineers, regional managers, executives, and regulators.

Operational Environment:

    Hosting: Hybrid architecture with cloud-based analytics and on-premise components for real-time data ingestion from network equipment.
    Access Modes: Web-based interface for office users, mobile applications for field engineers, and API integrations for third-party tools.
    Usage Scenarios:
        A NOC engineer identifies performance degradation in a specific region and escalates the issue for immediate intervention.
        Field engineers receive a prioritized list of maintenance tasks with contextual diagnostics.
        Regional managers analyze trends to plan infrastructure investments.
        Regulators audit compliance logs to ensure adherence to regional telecom regulations.

2. Functional Requirements
Core Features:

    Real-Time Network Monitoring: Dashboards displaying performance metrics such as latency, packet loss, and bandwidth utilization.
    Predictive Analytics: Machine learning models to predict outages or performance degradation based on historical trends.
    Optimization Suggestions: Automated recommendations for improving network efficiency, such as rerouting traffic or balancing loads.
    Incident Management: Integrated ticketing system for logging and resolving issues.
    Regulatory Reporting: Automated generation of compliance reports tailored to regional requirements.
    Multi-Language Support: Interface translations for major European languages.
    API for Third-Party Integrations: Allow external systems to access metrics and reports.

Authentication Conditions & Frequency:

    Session Expiration: User sessions expire after 30 minutes of inactivity to reduce exposure.
    Sensitive Actions: Role-specific actions like editing configurations or generating compliance reports require re-authentication.
    Multi-Tiered Access: Permissions are assigned based on user roles, restricting sensitive features like manual configuration changes to authorized personnel.

Sensitivity of Actions & Permission Levels:

    Critical Operations: E.g., rerouting network traffic or modifying equipment configurations (restricted to NOC leads and above).
    Sensitive Reports: Access to compliance reports or network-wide performance summaries is limited to managerial roles and regulators.
    General Monitoring: Accessible to all users but with view-only restrictions for non-technical roles.

3. Non-Functional Requirements
Performance:

    Dashboards must update with no more than a 2-second delay under typical load.
    System supports up to 1 million telemetry data points processed per second.

Scalability:

    Must support doubling the user base and a 50% increase in telemetry volume over five years.
    Elastic cloud architecture ensures smooth scaling during peak periods.

Reliability:

    99.99% uptime required, with failover mechanisms for both cloud and on-premise components.
    System must recover from failures within 5 minutes to avoid prolonged outages.

Security:

    Data must be encrypted both in transit and at rest.
    Role-based access controls to prevent unauthorized access.
    Detailed logging of all user actions for traceability.

Usability:

    Mobile app optimized for field engineers, including offline functionality for remote areas.
    Intuitive dashboards with customizable widgets for different user roles.

Audit & Monitoring:

    Continuous logging of user actions and system events.
    Audit reports for all changes made to network configurations or compliance data.

4. Constraints
Technical Constraints:

    Legacy systems for certain network equipment provide limited telemetry formats, requiring custom parsers.
    On-premise data ingestion modules must comply with regional data sovereignty laws.

Compliance Requirements:

    GDPR compliance for personal data.
    Regional telecom regulatory standards for network performance and reporting.

Resource Constraints:

    Budget: â‚¬15 million over 3 years.
    Team: Initial team of 50 members, including developers, data scientists, and system architects.
    Timeline: Phased delivery over 24 months with quarterly milestones.

Integration Needs:

    Seamless integration with existing incident management tools and ERP systems.
    Ability to connect to vendor-specific APIs for diverse equipment brands.
