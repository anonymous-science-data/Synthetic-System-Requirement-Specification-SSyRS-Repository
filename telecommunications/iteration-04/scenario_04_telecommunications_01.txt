Telecommunications Software System Requirements Scenario
1. System Overview
System Purpose: The system is designed to manage dynamic resource allocation and service provisioning for a 5G network infrastructure, enabling real-time network slicing and optimized bandwidth utilization based on user demand and service-level agreements (SLAs).
Domain/Context: Telecommunications, specifically focusing on next-generation 5G networks and services.
Stakeholders:
Network Operators: Responsible for managing and maintaining the 5G network.
Service Providers: Offering specialized services (e.g., IoT connectivity, ultra-low latency applications).
Regulatory Bodies: Ensuring compliance with telecommunications standards and regulations.
End Users: Both individual customers and enterprises relying on consistent and high-quality network performance.
User Base Characteristics:
Size: Millions of users, ranging from individual smartphone users to large enterprise clients.
Diversity: Includes residential customers, corporate entities, and IoT devices.
Geographic Distribution: Global, with concentrations in urban and suburban areas.
Roles: End-users, network administrators, and service developers.
2. Functional Requirements
Core Features:
Real-time monitoring and allocation of network resources across multiple network slices.
Automated provisioning of services based on customer profiles and SLAs.
Analytics dashboard for predictive maintenance and optimization.
API for third-party service integration and customization.
Frequency of Authentication:
End-users authenticate once per session, while administrators authenticate per action involving sensitive configurations.
APIs require token-based authentication refreshed every 24 hours.
Sensitivity of Actions:
High Sensitivity: Configuring network slices, modifying SLAs, and accessing performance analytics.
Medium Sensitivity: Viewing real-time usage statistics and standard user reports.
Low Sensitivity: Browsing general documentation and help resources.
3. Non-Functional Requirements
Performance:
Response time: Under 100ms for resource allocation changes.
System throughput: Handle up to 10 million concurrent connections.
Scalability:
Designed to support a 200% increase in traffic over 5 years without performance degradation.
Reliability:
99.999% uptime with automatic failover and disaster recovery within 15 minutes.
Security:
End-to-end encryption for all data in transit and at rest.
Role-based access control with multi-factor authentication for administrators.
Usability:
Intuitive interface for administrators with role-specific dashboards.
Accessible design adhering to WCAG 2.1 standards for visually impaired users.
4. Constraints
Technical Constraints:
Must operate on existing cloud infrastructure (AWS and Azure).
Limited compatibility with legacy 4G network components.
Compliance Requirements:
Must comply with GDPR for user data within the EU.
Adherence to ISO 27001 for information security management.
Resource Constraints:
Development budget capped at $10 million.
Project timeline limited to 18 months.
Core development team of 20 engineers.
Integration Needs:
Seamless interoperability with existing OSS/BSS systems.
Must integrate with third-party applications using standardized RESTful APIs and OpenAPI specifications.
