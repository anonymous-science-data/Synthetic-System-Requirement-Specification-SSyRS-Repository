Telecommunications Software System Requirements Scenario
1. System Overview
System Purpose: The system is designed to provide automated service assurance for a telecommunications provider's fiber-optic network. It will monitor network health, predict potential issues using AI/ML models, and initiate proactive maintenance workflows to minimize downtime and improve service reliability.
Domain/Context: Telecommunications, specifically targeting the management of fiber-optic network infrastructure for high-speed internet and enterprise connectivity services.
Stakeholders:
Network Operations Teams: Utilize the system to monitor, diagnose, and resolve network issues.
End Customers: Benefit from improved network reliability and reduced outages.
Service Technicians: Receive automated and prioritized maintenance tickets.
Regulators: Ensure the system meets operational standards and compliance requirements.
User Base Characteristics:
Size: Approximately 500 operations staff and 5,000 field technicians.
Diversity: Includes technical staff with varying expertise, from junior operators to senior engineers.
Geographic Distribution: Covers urban and rural areas in multiple countries.
Roles: Network operators, field technicians, system administrators, and data analysts.
2. Functional Requirements
Core Features:
Real-time network monitoring with alerting for threshold breaches.
AI-driven predictive analytics for identifying potential network failures.
Automated creation and assignment of maintenance tasks based on severity and location.
Visual dashboards for operational insights and SLA compliance tracking.
Frequency of Authentication:
Network operators authenticate once per session, with re-authentication required for high-privilege actions.
Field technicians authenticate per maintenance task assignment.
Sensitivity of Actions:
High Sensitivity: Modifying predictive analytics algorithms or accessing raw network data.
Medium Sensitivity: Approving maintenance tickets for critical failures.
Low Sensitivity: Viewing performance metrics and maintenance summaries.
3. Non-Functional Requirements
Performance:
System must process up to 1 million data points per second during peak monitoring periods.
Alerts for critical thresholds must trigger within 2 seconds of detection.
Scalability:
Must support a 100% increase in network nodes monitored over 5 years without degradation in performance.
Reliability:
99.999% uptime with automated failover to secondary systems within 30 seconds of primary system failure.
Security:
Role-based access control and encryption for all sensitive data at rest and in transit.
Mandatory multi-factor authentication for all administrative accounts.
Usability:
Intuitive dashboards for operators with minimal training requirements.
Mobile-friendly interfaces for field technicians to access tickets on-site.
4. Constraints
Technical Constraints:
Must be deployed on existing hybrid cloud infrastructure (AWS and on-premises systems).
Limited compatibility with older fiber-optic monitoring hardware.
Compliance Requirements:
Must adhere to GDPR and local data protection regulations in regions served.
Conformance with ISO 27001 for information security and ISO 9001 for quality management.
Resource Constraints:
Development budget capped at $12 million over 18 months.
Project team comprises 25 developers, 10 data scientists, and 15 QA engineers.
Integration Needs:
Integration with existing OSS/BSS systems for ticketing and network data.
Must support APIs for external reporting and third-party tools.
This scenario outlines a robust solution for automated service assurance in the telecommunications domain, reflecting realistic challenges and constraints for managing fiber-optic networks. Let me know if you need refinements or additional details!
