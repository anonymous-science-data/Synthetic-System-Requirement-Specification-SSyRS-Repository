1. System Overview
System Purpose:
To create a telecommunications fraud detection and prevention system that identifies suspicious activities in real time, minimizes financial losses, and protects customer data and services from unauthorized access and abuse.

Domain/Context:
Telecommunications sector, focusing on network security, fraud prevention, and customer protection.

Stakeholders:

Telecom Operators: Benefit from reduced fraud-related losses and improved operational efficiency.
Customers: Protected from unauthorized access, phishing, and fraudulent charges.
Fraud Analysts: Use the system to investigate alerts and implement preventive measures.
Regulatory Bodies: Monitor compliance with fraud and data protection laws.
User Base Characteristics:

Size: Tens of thousands of active users across telecom operators and analysts, with millions of indirectly protected customers.
Diversity: Covers users with varying levels of technical expertise, from fraud analysts to customers.
Geographic Distribution: Operates across multiple countries, adapting to regional fraud patterns.
Roles: System administrators, fraud analysts, telecom operators, and external auditors.
2. Functional Requirements
Core Features:

Real-time monitoring of call and data usage patterns to detect anomalies.
Automated alerts for suspicious activities, such as SIM cloning or excessive international calls.
Risk scoring based on user behavior and contextual data (e.g., location, usage history).
Secure interface for fraud analysts to review, investigate, and resolve flagged activities.
Customer notification system for potential fraud and account verification.
Frequency of Authentication:

Fraud Analysts: Per session, with additional authentication for high-sensitivity actions like locking accounts or altering risk thresholds.
Telecom Operators: Per session, with role-based authentication for accessing sensitive network configurations.
Customers: Per session for accessing fraud-related notifications or initiating account verification.
Sensitivity of Actions:

High sensitivity: Blocking accounts, modifying detection algorithms, accessing raw customer data.
Medium sensitivity: Reviewing flagged transactions, sending notifications.
3. Non-Functional Requirements
Performance:

System should flag potential fraud cases within 2 seconds of detecting anomalies.
Capable of processing data streams from 10 million active users simultaneously.
Scalability:

Designed to accommodate a 40% increase in customer base annually.
Elastic infrastructure to handle sudden spikes in activity, such as during large-scale fraud attempts.
Reliability:

99.99% uptime to ensure uninterrupted fraud monitoring.
Automatic failover mechanisms in case of server or network failures.
Security:

End-to-end encryption for all data transmission.
Multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all system users.
Compliance with ISO 27001 and region-specific data protection regulations.
Usability:

Intuitive interface for fraud analysts with visual data representations.
Accessible to non-technical users, with clear alerts and guided actions for customers.
4. Constraints
Technical Constraints:

Must be deployable on both cloud and on-premises systems.
Requires integration with existing billing, CRM, and network management platforms.
Compliance Requirements:

Adherence to GDPR, CCPA, and local telecom fraud prevention regulations.
Must support audit trails to meet regulatory reporting requirements.
Resource Constraints:

Development budget capped at $6 million.
Initial development team limited to 30 personnel, with phased scaling for support teams.
Integration Needs:

Seamless compatibility with existing fraud detection tools and telecom network analytics systems.
API support for external audit systems and regulatory reporting platforms.
