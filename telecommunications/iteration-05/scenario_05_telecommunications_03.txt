Scenario: Advanced Customer Experience Management System (CEMS) for Telecommunications
1. System Overview
System Purpose:
The system aims to provide a centralized platform for managing customer interactions and experiences across telecommunications services. It focuses on personalized service delivery, real-time resolution of issues, and analytics-driven customer retention.

Domain/Context:
The system operates within the telecommunications sector, serving mobile network operators, ISPs, and multi-service providers (mobile, internet, and television).

Stakeholders:

Customers: Individuals and businesses using telecom services who seek better issue resolution and self-service options.
Customer Support Teams: Handle customer queries, complaints, and escalations.
Marketing and Retention Teams: Use customer insights for targeted campaigns and retention strategies.
IT and Network Operations: Ensure system stability and scalability to support operations.
User Base Characteristics:

Size: Millions of customers and thousands of internal users.
Diversity: Individual consumers, SMEs, and large enterprises with varying service needs.
Geographic Distribution: Spanning urban, suburban, and rural regions.
Roles: Customers (self-service users), support staff, marketing analysts, and technical teams.
Operational Environment:
The system is hosted in a cloud-based environment to ensure scalability and availability. It is accessed via web portals, mobile apps, and integrated APIs. Edge computing is employed for rural areas to reduce latency in processing data from remote locations.

Usage Scenarios:

Customers: Use the self-service portal to troubleshoot issues, manage subscriptions, and monitor data usage.
Support Teams: Access a unified dashboard to track customer histories and resolve complaints.
Marketing Teams: Analyze customer behavior to launch retention campaigns.
2. Functional Requirements
Core Features:

AI-powered chatbot for resolving basic queries and directing unresolved cases to agents.
Real-time network diagnostics available to customers and support staff.
Analytics dashboard for customer usage patterns and churn prediction.
Workflow automation for ticketing and escalation processes.
Self-service tools for plan upgrades, payments, and service customizations.
Authentication Conditions & Frequency:

Customers authenticate through biometric or password-based methods on mobile apps.
Support agents must use MFA for access and reauthenticate every 12 hours or when accessing sensitive customer data.
Sensitivity of Actions & Permission Levels:

High Sensitivity: Customer data exports, subscription cancellations, and refunds (admin-level access).
Moderate Sensitivity: Viewing detailed customer usage patterns (support-level access).
Low Sensitivity: Accessing general account details and recent transactions (available to authenticated customers).
3. Non-Functional Requirements
Performance:

The system must handle 50,000 simultaneous user interactions with a response time under 1.5 seconds.
Scalability:

Must support a 100% increase in concurrent users during major promotional events.
Reliability:

99.99% uptime, with built-in failover mechanisms and proactive monitoring to identify potential failures.
Security:

End-to-end encryption for data at rest and in transit.
Adherence to PCI-DSS for payment processing and GDPR for customer data privacy.
Usability:

Mobile-first design with accessibility features such as voice navigation and multilingual support.
Audit & Monitoring:

Comprehensive audit logs for all system activities, retained for at least 5 years.
Regular reviews of authentication events and data access logs.
4. Constraints
Technical Constraints:

Must integrate with existing CRM and billing systems without disrupting operations.
Limited bandwidth in certain rural areas necessitates edge computing for local data processing.
Compliance Requirements:

Adherence to GDPR, CCPA, and regional telecom regulations regarding customer data handling and retention.
Meet specific service-level agreements (SLAs) for response and resolution times.
Resource Constraints:

Development budget capped at $4 million, with an 18-month implementation timeline.
A core team of 30 engineers, data analysts, and UX designers, supported by external consultants.
Integration Needs:

Seamless API integrations with third-party payment gateways and network monitoring tools.
Compatibility with legacy systems for customer account management.
This scenario presents a realistic and well-aligned vision of an Advanced Customer Experience Management System tailored to the telecommunications domain, addressing industry-specific challenges and goals.
