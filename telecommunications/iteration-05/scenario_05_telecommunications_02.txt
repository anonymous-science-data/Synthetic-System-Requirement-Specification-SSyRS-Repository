Scenario: Intelligent Network Management System (INMS) for Telecommunications Providers
1. System Overview
System Purpose:
The system is designed to provide real-time network management, monitoring, and optimization for telecommunications providers. Its primary goal is to ensure seamless connectivity, efficient resource allocation, and rapid troubleshooting of network issues across mobile, broadband, and enterprise services.

Domain/Context:
The telecommunications domain, focusing on network operations and optimization for mobile operators, ISPs, and enterprise service providers.

Stakeholders:

Network Operations Teams: Use the system to monitor and manage network health and capacity.
Field Technicians: Access network diagnostics and service request updates in real time.
Business Executives: Analyze performance and resource usage for strategic planning.
Regulatory Authorities: Ensure compliance with service quality and operational transparency.
User Base Characteristics:

Size: Thousands of internal users (engineers, technicians) and millions of monitored devices and endpoints.
Diversity: Includes local field technicians, regional operations managers, and centralized strategy teams.
Geographic Distribution: Nationwide or multi-national, covering urban and rural areas.
Roles: System users include network engineers, data analysts, service managers, and compliance officers.
Operational Environment:
The system will operate on a cloud-native architecture with on-premise edge nodes to handle latency-sensitive operations. It will be accessible via web portals, mobile apps for field technicians, and API integrations for third-party systems.

Usage Scenarios:

Network Engineers: Monitor and adjust network capacity during peak usage.
Field Technicians: Diagnose and resolve customer connectivity issues via mobile app access.
Executives: View high-level network performance dashboards for decision-making.
2. Functional Requirements
Core Features:

Real-time network monitoring and alerting with AI-based anomaly detection.
Dynamic resource allocation for load balancing across network nodes.
Incident management and ticketing system integrated with diagnostics tools.
Predictive analytics for capacity planning and fault prevention.
Self-service tools for technicians to access detailed network diagnostics.
Authentication Conditions & Frequency:

Single Sign-On (SSO) with multi-factor authentication (MFA) required for all roles.
Persistent session for low-sensitivity operations but reauthentication for accessing incident resolution tools or administrative actions.
Sensitivity of Actions & Permission Levels:

High Sensitivity: Network configuration changes, rerouting traffic, and shutting down nodes (requires admin privileges).
Moderate Sensitivity: Viewing detailed performance logs and diagnostics (restricted to engineers and managers).
Low Sensitivity: Accessing high-level performance dashboards and alerts (available to all authenticated users).
3. Non-Functional Requirements
Performance:

Must process 100,000 network events per second with a response time under 1 second for alerts.
Scalability:

Able to scale to support 10 million endpoints and a 200% increase in event volume during peak usage periods.
Reliability:

99.995% system uptime with automatic failover and redundancy across multiple regions.
Security:

Full compliance with ISO 27001 and regional data protection laws (e.g., GDPR).
Role-based access control (RBAC) with granular permissions.
Usability:

User-friendly interfaces with role-specific dashboards and mobile-friendly designs.
Accessibility features, including screen reader support and localization for multiple languages.
Audit & Monitoring:

Comprehensive logging of all system events and user activities.
Audit logs retained for 7 years to meet regulatory and operational requirements.
4. Constraints
Technical Constraints:

Must operate with existing legacy network management tools while supporting 5G and IoT protocols.
Limited bandwidth for rural areas where field technicians operate.
Compliance Requirements:

Adherence to service quality standards as mandated by regulatory authorities (e.g., ITU, FCC).
Compliance with data sovereignty laws in key regions of operation.
Resource Constraints:

Initial development budget capped at $3 million, with a phased rollout over 18 months.
Team of 25 engineers, analysts, and designers with access to external consultants as needed.
Integration Needs:

Seamless integration with existing OSS/BSS systems, third-party incident management platforms, and field service apps.
This scenario provides a realistic and comprehensive overview of an Intelligent Network Management System tailored for the telecommunications domain.
