Scenario: Unified Customer Billing and Service Platform for Telecommunications
1. System Overview
System Purpose:
The system aims to provide an integrated platform for telecommunications providers to manage customer billing, service subscriptions, and account-related interactions efficiently. It will enable real-time service activation, accurate billing calculations, and streamlined customer support.

Domain/Context:
The system operates in the telecommunications industry, catering to mobile network operators, internet service providers (ISPs), and bundled service providers offering mobile, broadband, and television packages.

Stakeholders:

Customers: Individuals and businesses using telecom services.
Customer Service Representatives (CSRs): Staff handling customer inquiries and issues.
Billing Administrators: Personnel responsible for ensuring billing accuracy.
Network Operations Team: Responsible for provisioning and managing network resources.
Regulatory Authorities: Ensure compliance with local telecom and data privacy laws.
User Base Characteristics:

Size: Millions of customers across various geographies.
Diversity: Ranges from individual consumers to enterprise clients with complex subscription needs.
Geographic Distribution: International, with multilingual and multi-currency requirements.
Roles: Customers (self-service users), internal staff (CSRs, billing admins), and regulatory auditors.
Operational Environment:
The system will be hosted on a hybrid architecture, combining cloud infrastructure for scalability and on-premise solutions for compliance with regional data residency laws. Users access the system via web portals, mobile apps, and API integrations.

Usage Scenarios:

Customers: View and pay bills, manage subscriptions, and update account details.
CSRs: Resolve billing disputes, modify service plans, and escalate technical issues.
Billing Admins: Audit billing cycles, resolve discrepancies, and manage payment gateways.
2. Functional Requirements
Core Features:

Real-time billing for services based on usage (e.g., data, voice minutes).
Automated service activation/deactivation based on customer actions.
Tiered subscription management, allowing bundling and discounts.
Self-service portal for customers to manage accounts and payments.
Comprehensive CSR dashboard for handling support requests and resolving issues.
Authentication Conditions & Frequency:

Customers authenticate via username/password or biometric login on mobile apps.
Admin users require two-factor authentication (2FA) for every login session and for executing sensitive operations like refunds.
Sensitivity of Actions & Permission Levels:

High Sensitivity: Service cancellations, refunds, and payment method updates (requires admin-level permissions).
Moderate Sensitivity: Plan changes, adding new subscriptions (requires manager-level permissions for enterprise accounts).
Low Sensitivity: Viewing account details or recent transactions (accessible to all authenticated users).
3. Non-Functional Requirements
Performance:

Must support 10,000 concurrent user sessions with an average response time under 2 seconds.
Scalability:

Handle a 50% increase in customer base during promotional campaigns without performance degradation.
Reliability:

Achieve 99.99% uptime, with failover mechanisms ensuring uninterrupted service during outages.
Security:

End-to-end encryption for data in transit and at rest.
Compliance with GDPR, CCPA, and regional telecom security standards.
Usability:

Intuitive interfaces for customer and admin users, with accessibility features compliant with WCAG 2.1.
Audit & Monitoring:

Real-time tracking of changes to subscriptions and billing data.
Logs maintained for at least five years to meet regulatory audit requirements.
4. Constraints
Technical Constraints:

Must integrate with existing CRM, ERP, and network provisioning systems.
Requires support for legacy telecom protocols (e.g., SS7, SIP).
Compliance Requirements:

Must adhere to PCI-DSS for payment data security.
Regional compliance with data localization laws in key markets (e.g., India, EU).
Resource Constraints:

Initial development budget capped at $2 million.
Dedicated team of 20 developers and analysts with a timeline of 12 months.
Integration Needs:

Integration with existing authentication systems like Single Sign-On (SSO) for internal users.
API support for third-party payment gateways and partner applications.
This scenario outlines a realistic and industry-relevant case for a telecommunications software system.
