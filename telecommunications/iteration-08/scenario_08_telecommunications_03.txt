Telecommunications Software System Scenario

1. System Overview
System Purpose:
The system is designed to streamline and optimize the provisioning and activation of telecommunications services for a regional telecom provider. Its primary goal is to automate workflows for onboarding new customers, managing service changes, and deactivating services, reducing manual intervention and improving customer satisfaction.

Domain/Context:
The telecommunications industry, specifically focusing on customer lifecycle management, service provisioning, and billing integration.

Stakeholders:

Customer Service Representatives (CSRs): Manage customer accounts and initiate service requests.
Field Technicians: Perform on-site activations and repairs.
Network Operations Teams: Monitor and validate service activations.
IT Teams: Maintain system operations and ensure integration with billing and CRM systems.
Customers: Indirect stakeholders benefiting from faster provisioning and activation processes.
User Base Characteristics:

Size: Approximately 1,000 active users, including CSRs, field technicians, and IT staff.
Diversity: Users range from technical teams responsible for system maintenance to customer-facing staff with minimal technical expertise.
Geographic Distribution: Regional coverage across urban and suburban areas.
Roles: Customer service agents, field technicians, supervisors, and system administrators.
Operational Environment:
The system is a cloud-based platform with mobile and desktop interfaces. It supports offline functionality for field technicians working in areas with limited connectivity.

Usage Scenarios:

CSRs initiate service activations and update customer information.
Field technicians access and confirm provisioning tasks in the field.
Network operations validate service activation and troubleshoot failures.
IT teams monitor system health and integrate new services as needed.
2. Functional Requirements
Core Features:

Automated workflows for service provisioning and deactivation.
Real-time validation of network availability and resource allocation.
Integration with billing and CRM systems for account updates.
Notifications to customers about service status changes (e.g., activation complete).
Task assignment and tracking for field technicians.
Dashboards for supervisors to monitor provisioning timelines and exceptions.
Authentication Conditions & Frequency:

Users authenticate at the start of their session.
Re-authentication is required for accessing or modifying sensitive data, such as customer billing information or technical configurations.
Sessions expire after 12 hours of inactivity.
Sensitivity of Actions & Permission Levels:

High Sensitivity: Modifying network configurations or customer billing data (admin-level access).
Moderate Sensitivity: Approving service changes or viewing provisioning logs (supervisor-level access).
Low Sensitivity: Viewing task assignments and confirming task completion (technician-level access).
3. Non-Functional Requirements
Performance:

Real-time response for provisioning requests: <=2 seconds.
System must handle up to 5,000 concurrent users during peak periods.
Scalability:

The platform must scale to accommodate a 30% increase in service requests within three years.
Support for adding new service types and network elements without significant downtime.
Reliability:

99.9% uptime, with failover mechanisms ensuring continuity during server outages.
Daily automated backups and disaster recovery within 4 hours of critical failures.
Security:

Data encryption for all transmissions and stored information.
Role-based access control with periodic audits to ensure proper usage.
Usability:

Simple interface for CSRs with minimal training requirements.
Mobile app designed for technicians with offline capabilities and intuitive workflows.
Audit & Monitoring:

Detailed logs of all service provisioning activities, retained for five years.
Real-time monitoring of system performance and task completion rates.
4. Constraints
Technical Constraints:

The system must integrate seamlessly with legacy billing and CRM platforms.
Support for mobile devices with limited processing power and connectivity.
Compliance Requirements:

Adherence to GDPR for handling customer data.
Compliance with regional telecommunications regulations governing service provisioning.
Resource Constraints:

Budget: $6 million over two years, covering development, deployment, and initial maintenance.
Team Size: 40-member team, including developers, QA engineers, UX designers, and telecom domain specialists.
Time-frame: 24 months for development and deployment, with a 6-month buffer for unforeseen challenges.
Integration Needs:

Integration with existing network monitoring, billing, and CRM systems.
APIs for extending functionality to external applications, such as customer self-service portals.
This scenario describes a realistic and well-defined system for service provisioning in the telecommunications industry, with a balanced scope and resource allocation that reflects real-world complexities and challenges.
