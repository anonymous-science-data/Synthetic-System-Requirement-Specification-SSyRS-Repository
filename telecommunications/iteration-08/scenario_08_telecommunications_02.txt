Telecommunications Software System Scenario

1. System Overview
System Purpose:
The system is designed to centralize and automate customer complaint management for a mid-sized telecommunications provider, ensuring faster resolution times, improved customer satisfaction, and actionable insights for reducing recurring issues. The system also integrates with network management tools to correlate customer issues with network events.

Domain/Context:
The telecommunications industry, focusing on customer experience management, complaint resolution, and network performance analysis.

Stakeholders:

Customer Support Representatives (CSRs): Use the system to log, track, and resolve customer complaints.
Network Operations Teams: Analyze customer complaints alongside network events to identify root causes.
Managers and Executives: Monitor resolution times, recurring issues, and overall system performance.
Customers: Benefit indirectly through improved issue resolution and proactive service improvements.
User Base Characteristics:

Size: Approximately 500 active users, primarily CSRs, network engineers, and supervisors.
Diversity: Users range from technical teams with engineering expertise to customer service teams with non-technical backgrounds.
Geographic Distribution: Offices in urban centers and remote regional hubs.
Roles: Customer support agents, network analysts, supervisors, and system administrators.
Operational Environment:
The system is cloud-based, accessible via desktop for office staff and mobile platforms for field agents. It includes APIs for integration with existing network monitoring tools.

Usage Scenarios:

CSRs log complaints and provide real-time updates to customers.
Network engineers correlate complaints with ongoing network events to diagnose root causes.
Supervisors generate reports on complaint trends and team performance.
Automated workflows prioritize high-severity complaints, notifying appropriate teams immediately.
2. Functional Requirements
Core Features:

Complaint logging and tracking, with support for attaching files and screenshots.
Integration with network monitoring systems to automatically flag potential network-related issues.
Workflow automation for routing complaints to the correct team based on type and severity.
Real-time dashboards showing complaint volumes, resolution times, and trends.
SLA tracking to ensure compliance with resolution time commitments.
Reporting tools for supervisors to identify recurring issues and evaluate team performance.
Authentication Conditions & Frequency:

Users authenticate at the beginning of each session.
Sensitive actions, such as modifying SLAs or accessing full customer data, require re-authentication.
Sessions expire after 8 hours of inactivity.
Sensitivity of Actions & Permission Levels:

High Sensitivity: Modifying SLAs or accessing customer PII (admin-level access).
Moderate Sensitivity: Reviewing complaint trends and network logs (analyst-level access).
Low Sensitivity: Logging complaints and updating status (CSR-level access).
3. Non-Functional Requirements
Performance:

Average response time for complaint entry and dashboard updates: <=2 seconds.
The system must handle up to 1,000 concurrent users without performance degradation.
Scalability:

Must scale to support a 50% increase in user base and data volume over five years.
Ability to accommodate new data integrations, such as additional monitoring tools or CRM systems.
Reliability:

99.8% system uptime with failover capabilities ensuring no more than 1 hour of downtime in case of failure.
Automatic data backup every 4 hours, with recovery mechanisms in place.
Security:

Role-based access controls and encrypted storage for sensitive data.
Regular security audits and vulnerability assessments.
Usability:

Simple, intuitive interface with minimal training required for CSRs.
Accessible design meeting WCAG 2.1 guidelines for users with disabilities.
Audit & Monitoring:

Full logging of user actions, retained for 5 years.
Monitoring of system performance and network connectivity in real time.
4. Constraints
Technical Constraints:

Must integrate seamlessly with existing CRM and network monitoring tools.
Mobile application must function in offline mode with automatic synchronization upon reconnecting.
Compliance Requirements:

GDPR compliance for handling customer data.
Adherence to ISO/IEC 20000 standards for IT service management.
Resource Constraints:

Budget: $5 million over two years, covering development, deployment, and initial maintenance.
Team: 30-member team, including developers, QA engineers, UX designers, and telecom domain experts.
Time-frame: 20 months for development and deployment, including a 4-month buffer for unforeseen challenges.
Integration Needs:

Integration with existing customer relationship management (CRM) tools and network monitoring systems.
APIs for exporting complaint data to external analytics platforms.
This scenario outlines a practical approach to developing a centralized customer complaint management system for a telecommunications provider, balancing functionality, performance, and resource allocation while aligning with industry-specific requirements.
