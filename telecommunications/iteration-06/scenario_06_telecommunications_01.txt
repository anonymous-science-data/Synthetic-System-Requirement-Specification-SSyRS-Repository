Telecommunications Software System Requirements
1. System Overview
System Purpose:
The system aims to streamline the management of network resources, monitor real-time usage, and automate fault detection across a telecommunications network. The primary goal is to enhance service reliability and efficiency while providing a seamless experience for both administrators and end-users.

Domain/Context:
Telecommunications, specifically focusing on network operations and service delivery for mobile and broadband services.

Stakeholders:

Network Operations Center (NOC) Teams: Responsible for monitoring and resolving network issues.
Field Technicians: Use the system to receive work orders and diagnostics for on-site repairs.
Customer Service Representatives: Access network status to provide real-time updates to customers.
Telecommunications Executives: Use performance analytics for strategic decision-making.
User Base Characteristics:

Large and diverse user base, including 1,000+ internal staff spread globally.
Roles include administrators, NOC operators, field technicians, and customer service representatives.
Users are distributed across multiple time zones, with 24/7 operational requirements.
Operational Environment:

The system is cloud-based, accessible via web and mobile applications, ensuring global availability and redundancy.
Mobile access is optimized for field technicians, while administrators use web-based dashboards.
Usage Scenarios:

Real-Time Fault Monitoring: NOC teams monitor live network health dashboards to identify and escalate faults.
Work Order Management: Field technicians receive location-specific repair tickets with diagnostic information.
Service Status Updates: Customer service teams provide real-time service status and outage details to customers.
Executive Reporting: Executives generate monthly reports on network performance, downtime trends, and resource utilization.
2. Functional Requirements
Core Features:

Live network health visualization with detailed fault logs.
Automated alerts for predefined thresholds (e.g., latency spikes, hardware failures).
Workflow tools for assigning and tracking field service tasks.
Performance analytics and reporting tools.
Role-based dashboards tailored for different user types.
Authentication Conditions & Frequency:

Users authenticate once per session. Sessions expire after 12 hours of inactivity.
Re-authentication is required for sensitive actions, such as modifying network configurations or accessing executive-level reports.
Sensitivity of Actions & Permission Levels:

High Sensitivity: Configuration changes, restricted to administrators.
Medium Sensitivity: Work order approval, accessible to NOC managers.
Low Sensitivity: Viewing live network data, available to all operational roles.
3. Non-Functional Requirements
Performance:

The system must display live dashboards with a maximum latency of 3 seconds.
Able to process 10,000 simultaneous user sessions without performance degradation.
Scalability:

Capable of scaling to support a 30% annual increase in users and a 50% increase in data volume.
Reliability:

99.99% uptime requirement, with automated failover mechanisms for critical components.
Security:

End-to-end encryption for all data in transit and at rest.
Multi-tier access control with regular penetration testing.
Usability:

Intuitive interfaces for all user roles, with mobile optimization for field technicians.
Localization support for up to 10 languages.
Audit & Monitoring:

Comprehensive logging of all user actions, especially for sensitive operations.
Alerts for suspicious authentication attempts, with detailed reports available for compliance audits.
4. Constraints
Technical Constraints:

Must integrate with existing network management systems (e.g., OSS/BSS platforms).
Supports mobile devices with Android 10+ and iOS 13+.
Compliance Requirements:

Must comply with GDPR and regional data protection laws.
Adheres to industry standards such as ISO 27001 for information security.
Resource Constraints:

Budget capped at $5 million for initial development.
Deployment timeline limited to 18 months, with phased rollouts every 6 months.
Integration Needs:

Requires seamless integration with legacy authentication systems for single sign-on.
Compatible with third-party API endpoints for fault logging and ticketing systems.
This scenario provides a coherent and realistic set of requirements tailored to the telecommunications sector.
