Telecommunications Software System Requirements
1. System Overview
System Purpose:
The system is designed to enhance the efficiency of provisioning and managing customer connections for fiber-optic broadband services. It automates service activation workflows, monitors real-time connection health, and provides tools for customer issue resolution.

Domain/Context:
The system operates in the telecommunications sector, focusing on fiber-optic broadband service management and customer support.

Stakeholders:

Provisioning Teams: Handle service activations and connection setups.
Customer Support Teams: Use the system to diagnose and resolve customer issues.
Network Engineers: Monitor connection health and resolve technical faults.
Executive Leadership: Review performance metrics for operational planning and decision-making.
User Base Characteristics:

Approximately 1,500 users distributed across regional offices in 15 countries.
Roles include administrators, provisioning agents, customer support representatives, and network engineers.
Operational Environment:

Cloud-based system with edge processing for real-time diagnostics.
Accessible via a web interface for office teams and a mobile application for on-site engineers.
Usage Scenarios:

Automated Provisioning: Provisioning agents initiate automated workflows for new customer connections.
Connection Monitoring: Engineers track connection health in real-time and receive alerts for degraded service.
Issue Resolution: Support teams access diagnostic tools to troubleshoot and resolve customer-reported issues.
Performance Reporting: Leadership reviews regional performance metrics for strategic planning.
2. Functional Requirements
Core Features:

Automated workflows for provisioning new customer connections.
Real-time connection monitoring with performance metrics and fault alerts.
Diagnostic tools for troubleshooting connectivity issues.
Reporting tools for operational metrics and customer satisfaction trends.
Role-based dashboards tailored to different user groups.
Authentication Conditions & Frequency:

Users authenticate at the start of their workday, with sessions expiring after 10 hours of inactivity.
Sensitive actions, such as customer account modifications or escalated issue resolutions, require re-authentication.
Sensitivity of Actions & Permission Levels:

High Sensitivity: Modifying network configurations or approving escalated cases, restricted to senior engineers and managers.
Medium Sensitivity: Adjusting customer provisioning details, accessible to provisioning agents.
Low Sensitivity: Viewing connection status and running diagnostics, available to support staff.
3. Non-Functional Requirements
Performance:

The system must process service provisioning requests within 5 seconds.
Real-time dashboards must update within 3 seconds of new diagnostic data.
Scalability:

Supports a 30% annual increase in customer connections and user base, with bursts during promotional campaigns.
Reliability:

Achieve 99.9% uptime with redundancy for critical components.
Graceful degradation for non-critical features during peak loads.
Security:

Data encryption for all customer and network data in transit and at rest.
Fine-grained access controls with region-specific restrictions.
Usability:

Interfaces designed for minimal training, with context-sensitive help for common tasks.
Mobile app optimized for offline use, syncing updates when connectivity is restored.
Audit & Monitoring:

Maintain logs for all provisioning actions, fault resolution steps, and user access events.
Alert administrators of unusual activity patterns, such as repeated failed access attempts.
4. Constraints
Technical Constraints:

The system must integrate with legacy provisioning systems for backward compatibility.
Mobile application support for devices running Android 10+ and iOS 13+.
Compliance Requirements:

Must comply with GDPR for customer data privacy and ISO 27001 for information security.
Align with national regulations for broadband service providers in each operational region.
Resource Constraints:

Development budget capped at $7 million, with a 24-month implementation timeline.
Integration Needs:

Seamless integration with existing OSS platforms for network operations.
API support for third-party diagnostic tools and CRM systems.
This scenario is carefully tailored to align with telecommunications industry requirements, focusing on provisioning and management for fiber-optic broadband services.
