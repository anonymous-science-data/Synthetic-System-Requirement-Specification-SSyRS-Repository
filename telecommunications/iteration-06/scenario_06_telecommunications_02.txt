Telecommunications Software System Requirements
1. System Overview
System Purpose:
The system is designed to optimize the deployment, monitoring, and maintenance of 5G network infrastructure. Its primary goals are to provide a unified platform for network configuration, automate fault resolution workflows, and improve visibility into network performance metrics for internal teams.

Domain/Context:
The system operates in the telecommunications sector, specifically focusing on 5G network operations, deployment management, and quality assurance.

Stakeholders:

Network Operations Teams: Monitor, manage, and troubleshoot network issues.
Field Deployment Engineers: Use the system to receive and log updates on installation and maintenance tasks.
Product Managers: Track key performance indicators (KPIs) of the network for service-level agreement (SLA) compliance.
Executive Leadership: Leverage strategic insights from network analytics for planning expansions.
User Base Characteristics:

Approximately 2,000 users globally, including administrators, engineers, and operational staff.
Distributed across 12 regions where the organization has active 5G network rollouts.
Roles include administrators, monitoring operators, field engineers, and managers.
Operational Environment:

Cloud-based system hosted on a hybrid cloud infrastructure to balance scalability and data sovereignty requirements.
Access through a web portal for desktop users and a mobile application optimized for on-site engineers.
Usage Scenarios:

Automated Fault Handling: The system identifies issues in the 5G network, assigns tasks to field engineers, and tracks resolution progress.
Network Configuration Management: Administrators implement updates to network settings through a centralized interface.
Performance Analytics: Teams monitor SLA compliance through custom reports and dashboards.
Field Task Logging: Engineers log task completions and update status in real-time through the mobile application.
2. Functional Requirements
Core Features:

Real-time network monitoring and fault alerts with actionable insights.
Task management system for assigning, tracking, and closing field service tasks.
Centralized interface for 5G network configuration changes.
SLA compliance reporting and customizable dashboards.
Role-based access control to ensure appropriate access levels for users.
Authentication Conditions & Frequency:

Users authenticate at the start of each session, with sessions expiring after 8 hours of inactivity.
Sensitive actions, such as applying network configuration updates or closing critical faults, require re-authentication.
Sensitivity of Actions & Permission Levels:

High Sensitivity: Applying configuration changes, restricted to administrators.
Medium Sensitivity: Assigning field tasks, accessible to managers.
Low Sensitivity: Viewing network status or logging task updates, available to all roles.
3. Non-Functional Requirements
Performance:

Real-time dashboards must refresh within 2 seconds of an update.
Fault detection and task assignment must occur within 5 seconds of an issue being logged.
Scalability:

The system should support a 40% annual increase in users and data volume, accommodating growing 5G adoption rates.
Reliability:

99.95% uptime, with automated redundancy mechanisms for critical components.
Robust error handling for incomplete task updates or temporary loss of connectivity in the field.
Security:

Data encryption in transit and at rest.
Fine-grained access control mechanisms based on role and geographic region.
Usability:

Intuitive user interfaces designed for minimal training requirements.
Accessibility features to ensure compatibility with assistive technologies.
Audit & Monitoring:

Full audit logs of user actions, especially for sensitive tasks like configuration changes.
Real-time alerts for unauthorized access attempts or unusual activity patterns.
4. Constraints
Technical Constraints:

The system must integrate with existing OSS/BSS platforms for seamless operations.
Mobile application must be compatible with Android 11+ and iOS 14+.
Compliance Requirements:

Must comply with GDPR for handling customer and employee data.
Aligns with ISO 27001 standards for information security management.
Resource Constraints:

Development budget of $6 million, with a timeline of 20 months for full implementation.
Integration Needs:

Requires integration with legacy authentication systems for unified user management.
APIs must support interoperability with third-party fault detection and analytics tools.
This scenario provides a realistic, industry-aligned overview of a telecommunications software system tailored to manage and optimize 5G network operations.
