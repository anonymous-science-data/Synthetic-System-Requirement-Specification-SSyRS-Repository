Elastic infrastructure to handle seasonal traffic spikes (e.g., promotions or outages).
Reliability:

99.9% uptime, with automated failover and recovery processes for critical services.
Comprehensive error handling to ensure data integrity during system failures.
Security:

End-to-end encryption for sensitive data in transit and at rest.
Regular penetration testing to identify and mitigate vulnerabilities.
Usability:

Intuitive user interface with minimal training requirements for agents.
Mobile-friendly design for field technicians.
Accessibility features for users with disabilities.
4. Constraints
