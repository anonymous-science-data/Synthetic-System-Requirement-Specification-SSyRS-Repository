Scenario: Network Optimization and Incident Management System for Telecommunications
1. System Overview
System Purpose:
To provide a centralized platform for monitoring, optimizing, and managing network performance while enabling rapid incident resolution. The system focuses on enhancing network quality, minimizing downtime, and delivering actionable insights to support strategic planning.

Domain/Context:
Telecommunications, specifically focusing on mobile networks, broadband services, and enterprise connectivity.

Stakeholders:

Primary Stakeholders: Network operations teams, field engineers, and customer service representatives.
Secondary Stakeholders: Senior management, product teams, and regulators monitoring service quality.
End-Users: Indirect stakeholders including residential customers, businesses, and enterprise clients who benefit from improved network reliability.
User Base Characteristics:

Size: Approximately 8,000 internal users across network operations and customer support teams.
Diversity: Roles include engineers, analysts, and administrators with varying technical proficiency.
Geographic Distribution: Users spread across multiple regional offices and field locations globally.
Roles: End-users include system administrators, data analysts, and field engineers accessing via desktop and mobile interfaces.
2. Functional Requirements
Core Features:

Real-time Network Monitoring: Provide visual dashboards for monitoring network health and identifying anomalies.
Automated Incident Alerts: Notify relevant teams of potential issues using AI-based predictive analytics.
Root Cause Analysis: Offer tools to diagnose issues by correlating network performance data and historical trends.
Workforce Coordination: Enable scheduling and dispatch of field engineers for incident resolution.
Reporting and Insights: Generate periodic reports on network performance, uptime, and incident resolution metrics.
Frequency of Authentication:

Administrators: Authenticate per session with reauthentication required for configuration changes.
Engineers and Analysts: Authenticate per session with optional biometric authentication for field access.
End-Users: Indirectly impacted, with no direct authentication required.
Sensitivity of Actions:

High Sensitivity: Modifying network configurations, accessing customer-specific data, and approving changes to service settings.
Moderate Sensitivity: Viewing real-time network analytics and incident history.
Low Sensitivity: Accessing general performance reports and non-customer-specific trends.
3. Non-Functional Requirements
Performance:

Must support simultaneous monitoring of 20,000 network nodes with less than a 1-second refresh interval for critical metrics.
Scalability:

Designed to scale up to 50,000 network nodes and 12,000 concurrent users over the next three years.
Adaptive infrastructure to manage sudden increases in data flow due to service expansions or unexpected outages.
Reliability:

Ensure 99.95% uptime, with redundant systems to handle critical data streams.
Comprehensive disaster recovery plan to restore functionality within 4 hours of a major failure.
Security:

Multi-factor authentication (MFA) for sensitive roles.
Data encryption for all information in transit and at rest.
Regular security audits to comply with cybersecurity best practices.
Usability:

Simple, intuitive dashboards with customizable views for different user roles.
Mobile-friendly access for field engineers with offline capabilities for areas without connectivity.
Accessibility compliance for users with disabilities.
4. Constraints
Technical Constraints:

Integration with existing network management tools and data repositories.
Limited availability of high-bandwidth infrastructure in remote field locations.
Compliance Requirements:

Adherence to GDPR and industry-specific regulations on data handling and retention.
Conformance with telecom service quality standards mandated by regulators.
Resource Constraints:

Budget capped at $7 million with a 15-month implementation timeline.
Limited availability of skilled AI specialists for predictive analytics development.
Integration Needs:

Seamless interoperability with legacy network monitoring platforms, ticketing systems, and third-party analytics tools.
Must support Single Sign-On (SSO) for authentication across all integrated platforms.
