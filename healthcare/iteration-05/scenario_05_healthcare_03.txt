Healthcare Software System Requirements Scenario
1. System Overview
System Purpose:
The system, named "CareSync," is designed to optimize patient care coordination and operational efficiency by providing a comprehensive, integrated platform for healthcare professionals, patients, and ancillary services. Its primary objectives are to enhance patient engagement, reduce medical errors, and streamline administrative tasks.

Domain/Context:
CareSync operates within the healthcare industry, targeting medium to large multi-specialty hospitals and outpatient clinics that aim to integrate clinical, administrative, and patient-facing services into a single solution.

Stakeholders:

Primary: Doctors, nurses, care managers, and administrative staff.
Secondary: Patients, laboratory technicians, insurance companies, and healthcare regulators.
User Base Characteristics:
CareSync is designed for a diverse user base of approximately 15,000 daily users, spanning healthcare providers, administrative staff, and patients. The system must accommodate varying levels of technological literacy and support users across urban, suburban, and rural regions.

Operational Environment:
The system is a hybrid solution hosted on a cloud-based infrastructure for external access and local on-premise servers for critical in-hospital operations. It supports desktop, tablet, and mobile access to ensure flexibility across user roles and environments.

Usage Scenarios:

Healthcare Providers: Recording patient encounters, prescribing medications, and reviewing lab results.
Administrative Staff: Scheduling appointments, processing insurance claims, and managing billing workflows.
Patients: Accessing test results, managing appointments, and updating their health information.
Ancillary Services: Uploading diagnostic reports and sharing updates with care teams.
2. Functional Requirements
Core Features:

Unified patient health records with chronological views of past and ongoing treatments.
Role-based dashboards for providers, patients, and administrators.
Automated appointment reminders via SMS and email.
A secure communication module for provider-patient messaging.
Integration with external lab and imaging systems for seamless data sharing.
Authentication Conditions & Frequency:

Staff authenticate through SSO using biometrics or tokens, with re-authentication required for sensitive actions like editing patient diagnoses.
Patients authenticate with 2FA during every login session.
Session timeouts occur after 30 minutes of inactivity for all users.
Sensitivity of Actions & Permission Levels:

High Sensitivity: Accessing or modifying critical medical data (restricted to licensed medical professionals).
Moderate Sensitivity: Ordering lab tests or approving claims (accessible to providers and administrative staff).
Low Sensitivity: Viewing appointment schedules or updating contact details (accessible to all users).
3. Non-Functional Requirements
Performance:
The system must provide sub-2-second response times for 90% of user interactions and handle peak loads of up to 10,000 concurrent users.

Scalability:
CareSync must scale to accommodate a 50% growth in user base over five years, supporting additional facilities and services without performance degradation.

Reliability:
The system requires 99.9% uptime, with built-in failover mechanisms ensuring recovery within 5 minutes of outages.

Security:
All data must be encrypted using AES-256 at rest and TLS 1.3 in transit. Multi-layered access controls must be implemented to meet HIPAA and GDPR requirements.

Usability:
The interface must be intuitive and support multi-language options to accommodate non-native English speakers. It must also comply with WCAG 2.1 AA standards for accessibility.

Audit & Monitoring:
All critical user actions, including authentication events, data edits, and system modifications, must be logged and retained for 7 years for compliance and forensic purposes.

4. Constraints
Technical Constraints:

The system must integrate with existing EHR systems using industry-standard protocols like HL7 or FHIR.
Compatibility with older devices (minimum Android 8.0 and Windows 10) is required.
Compliance Requirements:

The system must comply with HIPAA, HITECH, and GDPR standards.
Periodic third-party audits and penetration testing are mandatory to ensure compliance.
Resource Constraints:

The project budget is limited to $5 million for development and the first year of operations.
A 16-month timeline is set for initial implementation across the first 10 facilities.
Integration Needs:

Integration with external lab systems, imaging providers, and insurance portals is required.
The system must also support APIs for future expansion into telemedicine and wearable device data ingestion.
This scenario provides a realistic set of requirements tailored to the healthcare domain, addressing its specific challenges, goals, and constraints.
