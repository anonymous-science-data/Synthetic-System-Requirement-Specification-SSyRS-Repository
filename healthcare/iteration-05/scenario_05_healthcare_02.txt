Healthcare Software System Requirements Scenario
1. System Overview
System Purpose:
The system, called "MediConnect," is designed to improve care coordination by enabling seamless communication and data sharing among healthcare providers, patients, and insurance companies. The goal is to enhance patient outcomes, reduce care delays, and ensure compliance with regulatory requirements.

Domain/Context:
MediConnect operates in the healthcare domain, targeting regional hospital networks, independent clinics, and home healthcare services.

Stakeholders:

Primary: Physicians, nurses, care coordinators, and administrative staff.
Secondary: Patients, insurance adjusters, healthcare IT teams, and regulators.
User Base Characteristics:
The system serves approximately 8,000 daily users, including healthcare providers in various roles and patients across multiple regions. The user base includes a mix of urban and rural populations, with varying levels of access to high-speed internet.

Operational Environment:
MediConnect is hosted on a hybrid infrastructure, combining on-premise servers for critical hospital operations and a cloud-based portal for patient and remote staff access. Mobile accessibility is prioritized for home healthcare workers and patients.

Usage Scenarios:

Healthcare Providers: Updating patient records during rounds, ordering tests, and coordinating care plans with other specialists.
Administrative Staff: Scheduling appointments, verifying insurance eligibility, and submitting claims.
Patients: Accessing test results, updating personal details, and communicating with their care team through a secure chat feature.
2. Functional Requirements
Core Features:

A unified patient dashboard with a chronological view of medical history, medications, and test results.
Interoperability with regional EHR systems to enable data exchange.
Integrated messaging to facilitate secure communication between patients and providers.
Automated alerts for critical updates such as abnormal test results or missed follow-ups.
Authentication Conditions & Frequency:

Providers authenticate once per shift using biometric or token-based authentication, with re-authentication required for accessing high-sensitivity data.
Patients authenticate at each login via username, password, and optional biometric verification on supported devices.
Sensitivity of Actions & Permission Levels:

High Sensitivity: Editing patient diagnoses and treatment plans (restricted to physicians).
Moderate Sensitivity: Ordering tests or accessing insurance claim details (accessible to nurses and administrative staff).
Low Sensitivity: Viewing appointment schedules or updating patient contact details (accessible to all staff).
3. Non-Functional Requirements
Performance:
The system must process patient record updates within 3 seconds and handle up to 5,000 concurrent users during peak hours.

Scalability:
MediConnect should scale to support additional hospital networks and clinics without performance degradation, with capacity to grow the user base by 30% annually.

Reliability:
The system must provide 99.8% uptime, with automated failover and recovery within 5 minutes of a critical failure.

Security:
Data must be encrypted in transit and at rest, with advanced threat detection systems to guard against breaches. Role-based access control must enforce least-privilege principles.

Usability:
The interface must support multi-language options and comply with WCAG 2.1 AA standards to ensure accessibility for users with disabilities.

Audit & Monitoring:
All user actions, particularly those involving sensitive data, must be logged and stored for 6 years, with real-time monitoring for suspicious activity.

4. Constraints
Technical Constraints:

The system must operate on hospital-grade servers with minimal downtime during upgrades.
Limited compatibility with legacy systems older than 2015, requiring middleware for integration.
Compliance Requirements:

Full compliance with HIPAA, HITECH, and state-specific healthcare regulations.
Regular external audits to maintain certification and trust.
Resource Constraints:

Development budget capped at $3 million, with 14 months allocated for the initial implementation phase.
Limited in-house expertise in cloud-based security, necessitating partnerships with specialized vendors.
Integration Needs:

Integration with existing hospital EHR systems, diagnostic lab platforms, and insurance claim processing tools.
API support for third-party wearable devices for future expansion into remote monitoring solutions.
This scenario captures realistic requirements for a healthcare system while addressing challenges such as scalability, regulatory compliance, and technical constraints.
