1. System Overview
System Purpose:
The system, "HealthTrack AI," is designed to provide predictive analytics and personalized care recommendations for chronic disease management. It uses AI algorithms to monitor patient health, predict complications, and suggest actionable insights to both patients and healthcare providers.

Domain/Context:
The healthcare domain, with a focus on chronic disease management (e.g., diabetes, hypertension, heart disease).

Stakeholders:
Key stakeholders include:

Patients: Individuals managing chronic conditions.
Healthcare Providers: Physicians, specialists, and care coordinators.
Caregivers: Family members or assigned caregivers supporting patients.
Health Insurance Companies: Evaluating long-term patient outcomes and healthcare costs.
User Base Characteristics:

Size: Moderate to large, depending on adoption (thousands to tens of thousands of users).
Diversity: Includes patients with varying levels of technical proficiency, healthcare providers across specialties, and caregivers with limited healthcare training.
Geographic Distribution: Distributed across urban, rural, and remote areas with internet connectivity.
Roles: Patients, doctors, nurse practitioners, data analysts, and family caregivers.
2. Functional Requirements
Core Features:

Health Monitoring: Integration with wearable devices to track vitals (e.g., blood pressure, glucose levels).
Predictive Analytics: AI-powered predictions of potential complications based on health data trends.
Personalized Recommendations: Actionable insights such as medication reminders, lifestyle tips, or dietary changes.
Communication Portal: Secure messaging between patients and providers for real-time feedback.
Dashboard: Centralized health status overview for patients and providers.
Frequency of Authentication:

Patients and Caregivers: Authenticate per session.
Healthcare Providers: Authenticate per session, with reauthentication for high-sensitivity actions like modifying recommendations.
Sensitivity of Actions:

High Sensitivity: Updating patient records, modifying AI recommendations, or accessing detailed analytics.
Moderate Sensitivity: Viewing health trends or sending non-critical communications.
Low Sensitivity: Browsing general recommendations or accessing non-personalized insights.
3. Non-Functional Requirements
Performance:

Predictive analytics results within 3 seconds.
Support for 10,000 concurrent users without system slowdown.
Scalability:

Ability to expand services to millions of users with cloud-based architecture.
Dynamic resource allocation for peak usage times.
Reliability:

99.9% uptime with robust failover capabilities.
Automated recovery for minor faults within 1 minute.
Security:

Encrypted data transfer and storage for compliance with healthcare data standards.
Role-based access control with audit trails for all actions.
Usability:

Designed for non-technical users, with an intuitive interface and simple navigation.
Accessibility features for visually impaired users and those with limited mobility.
4. Constraints
Technical Constraints:

Must integrate with wearable device platforms (e.g., Apple Health, Fitbit).
Operable on mobile devices, tablets, and desktops with minimal system requirements.
Compliance Requirements:

Fully compliant with HIPAA (U.S.) and GDPR (EU) regulations.
Adherence to ISO standards for healthcare software development.
Resource Constraints:

Initial development budget capped at $3 million.
A team of 12 developers, with deployment targeted within 14 months.
