1. System Overview
System Purpose:
The system, "MedAlert Pro," is designed to streamline emergency response workflows in healthcare facilities. It provides real-time communication, resource allocation, and monitoring to ensure optimal patient care during critical situations.

Domain/Context:
The healthcare domain, specifically focusing on hospital and clinic emergency management and operational efficiency.

Stakeholders:
Key stakeholders include:

Healthcare Providers: Physicians, nurses, paramedics, and other medical staff.
Administrative Staff: Hospital administrators and operational managers.
Patients: Individuals requiring immediate or ongoing medical attention.
Regulatory Bodies: Agencies ensuring compliance with healthcare standards and regulations.
User Base Characteristics:

Size: Medium to large, depending on the scale of the facility (hundreds to thousands of users).
Diversity: Users range from tech-savvy administrators to medical professionals with minimal technical expertise.
Geographic Distribution: Primarily localized to specific hospital networks or clinics, with potential expansion to regional or national levels.
Roles: Physicians, nurses, IT administrators, emergency response coordinators, and regulatory auditors.
2. Functional Requirements
Core Features:

Real-Time Alerts: Immediate notifications for critical events (e.g., patient deterioration, resource shortages).
Resource Management: Tracking availability of beds, equipment, and personnel.
Communication Hub: Secure messaging and video conferencing among medical teams.
Incident Documentation: Automated logging of critical event timelines and outcomes.
Integration: Seamless interoperability with Electronic Health Records (EHR) and other hospital management systems.
Frequency of Authentication:

Users authenticate once per session with periodic reauthentication for high-sensitivity actions.
Sensitivity of Actions:

High Sensitivity: Approving resource allocation, accessing patient medical histories, and initiating emergency protocols.
Moderate Sensitivity: Internal communication and general status updates.
Low Sensitivity: Non-critical system navigation and data entry.
3. Non-Functional Requirements
Performance:

Average response time: < 2 seconds for critical alerts.
System throughput: Capable of handling up to 10,000 concurrent events.
Scalability:

Designed to scale horizontally with increasing users and facilities.
Supports onboarding of additional hospitals or clinics without downtime.
Reliability:

99.99% uptime with redundant server infrastructure.
Automatic failover mechanisms and regular data backups.
Security:

End-to-end encryption for data communication.
Multi-factor authentication for accessing sensitive features.
Role-based access controls to minimize exposure risks.
Usability:

Intuitive interface designed for minimal training.
Accessibility features such as screen readers and high-contrast modes for inclusivity.
4. Constraints
Technical Constraints:

Must operate on existing hospital IT infrastructure with minimal hardware upgrades.
Compatibility with Windows, macOS, and Linux systems for diverse user needs.
Compliance Requirements:

Fully compliant with HIPAA for patient data protection in the United States.
Adherence to GDPR for facilities operating in the European Union.
Resource Constraints:

Initial development budget capped at $2 million.
Dedicated team of 10 developers with 18 months for deployment.
Integration Needs:

The system must integrate seamlessly with existing EHR platforms like Epic and Cerner.
