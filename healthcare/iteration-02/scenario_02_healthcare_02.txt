Insurance Companies: Reviewing coordinated care plans and billing.
User Base Characteristics:

Size: Small to large, depending on the scale of implementation (dozens to thousands of users).
Diversity: Users range from highly specialized surgeons to general practitioners and non-clinical staff.
Geographic Distribution: Primarily within a single hospital or clinic but expandable to regional health networks.
Roles: Includes direct care providers, administrative coordinators, and patients accessing limited self-service features.
2. Functional Requirements
Core Features:

Care Team Assignment: Automatic grouping of care providers based on patient needs and provider availability.
Task Management: Creation, assignment, and tracking of tasks for individual patients.
Real-Time Updates: Notifications for changes in patient status or task assignments.
Patient Portal: A web and mobile app for patients to view appointments, task progress, and communicate with providers.
Data Analytics: Reporting tools to assess care team efficiency and patient outcomes.
Frequency of Authentication:

Users authenticate once per session with additional verification for accessing patient-sensitive data or altering schedules.
Sensitivity of Actions:

High Sensitivity: Viewing or updating patient medical data, modifying care plans, and accessing analytics.
Moderate Sensitivity: Assigning tasks and sending notifications to care teams.
Low Sensitivity: Viewing schedules or accessing non-sensitive system features.
3. Non-Functional Requirements
