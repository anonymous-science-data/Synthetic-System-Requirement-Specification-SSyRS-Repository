1. System Overview
System Purpose:
The proposed system is a Patient-Centered Care Coordination Platform (PCCP) designed to streamline communication, data sharing, and care planning between healthcare providers, patients, and caregivers. Its primary goal is to improve patient outcomes by enabling seamless collaboration, reducing administrative burdens, and ensuring adherence to care plans.

Domain/Context:
Healthcare, focusing on chronic disease management, post-operative care, and elderly care coordination within a hospital network that also includes community clinics and home-based care services.

Stakeholders:

Primary Users: Healthcare providers (doctors, nurses, care coordinators).
Secondary Users: Patients and their caregivers.
Administrative Users: IT administrators, compliance officers, and hospital management.
User Base Characteristics:

Approximately 10,000 users, including:
4,000 healthcare providers across multiple hospitals and clinics.
5,000 patients enrolled in chronic care management programs.
1,000 caregivers assisting patients.
Geographically dispersed across urban and rural regions.
User roles include clinical staff, non-clinical administrative personnel, patients, and non-medical caregivers.
Operational Environment:

Cloud-based platform with high availability to support access from desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
Accessible through secure hospital networks, as well as remotely for patients and caregivers.
Usage Scenarios:

A nurse updates a patient's post-operative care plan and shares it with the primary care physician and physical therapist.
A caregiver receives alerts for missed medication schedules and accesses educational materials about managing chronic conditions.
A patient logs symptoms daily, triggering alerts to the care team if deviations from expected recovery patterns occur.
An administrator generates audit logs to ensure compliance with healthcare regulations.
2. Functional Requirements
Core Features:

Centralized patient records with access control based on user roles.
Care plan creation, sharing, and real-time updates.
Secure messaging for inter-professional and patient-provider communication.
Patient task reminders and medication adherence tracking.
Reporting tools for clinical outcomes and operational performance.
Authentication Conditions & Frequency:

Authentication required at the start of every session.
Re-authentication required after 15 minutes of inactivity.
Sensitive actions (e.g., updating patient records, generating compliance reports) require role-specific re-authentication.
Sensitivity of Actions & Permission Levels:

High Sensitivity: Modifying patient care plans, sharing sensitive data, and generating compliance reports. Restricted to clinical staff and administrators.
Moderate Sensitivity: Viewing patient data, sending messages, and creating reminders. Accessible to care coordinators and authorized caregivers.
Low Sensitivity: Updating personal health information or completing patient surveys. Accessible to patients and caregivers.
3. Non-Functional Requirements
Performance:

Average response time under 2 seconds for core functions.
Support up to 2,000 concurrent users during peak hours.
Scalability:

Scale to support a 50% increase in the user base within 3 years without major infrastructure overhauls.
Reliability:

99.9% uptime with robust failover mechanisms to minimize service disruptions.
Automated daily backups and data recovery within 4 hours in case of failure.
Security:

Data encryption at rest and in transit.
Role-based access control and least privilege principle enforcement.
Usability:

Intuitive user interfaces with accessibility features such as screen readers and font resizing.
Multi-language support for patient and caregiver interfaces.
Audit & Monitoring:

Comprehensive logging of all user actions, with real-time alerts for anomalous activities.
Monthly audit reports generated automatically for compliance checks.
4. Constraints
Technical Constraints:

Must integrate with existing hospital Electronic Health Records (EHR) systems (e.g., Epic, Cerner).
Limited mobile app functionality in offline mode due to cloud reliance.
Compliance Requirements:

HIPAA for patient data privacy and security.
GDPR for handling data of European patients in cross-border collaborations.
Resource Constraints:

Budget: $5 million, allocated over two years for development, testing, and initial deployment.
Staffing: A team of 20, including project managers, developers, QA specialists, and domain experts.
Timeframe: 18 months, including a 3-month buffer for unexpected delays.
Integration Needs:

Interoperability with national health information exchanges and telehealth platforms.
Real-time integration with patient wearable devices for health monitoring.
