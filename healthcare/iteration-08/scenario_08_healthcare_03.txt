1. System Overview
System Purpose:
The system, Integrated Patient Discharge Management System (IPDMS), is designed to optimize hospital discharge processes by streamlining communication between medical staff, patients, and outpatient care providers. Its objectives are to reduce readmission rates, ensure continuity of care, and improve patient satisfaction by providing clear discharge instructions, medication reconciliation, and appointment scheduling.

Domain/Context:
Healthcare, with a focus on inpatient care transitions and post-discharge follow-up within large hospital networks and affiliated outpatient clinics.

Stakeholders:

Primary Users: Hospital discharge coordinators, physicians, and nurses.
Secondary Users: Patients and their families.
Administrative Users: Hospital administrators, compliance officers, and IT staff.
User Base Characteristics:

Approximately 12,000 users, including:
3,500 medical staff involved in discharge planning.
8,000 patients discharged monthly from hospital systems.
500 administrators overseeing compliance and system performance.
Users are geographically distributed across urban and suburban hospitals and clinics.
Operational Environment:

Cloud-hosted platform with on-premise integration for hospitals with legacy systems.
Accessible via desktops and mobile devices for medical staff; patients access the system through a mobile-friendly web portal or app.
Usage Scenarios:

A nurse enters discharge instructions and medication plans into the system, automatically generating patient-friendly summaries.
A patient receives reminders about follow-up appointments and prescribed medication schedules through the app.
A physician reviews discharge analytics to identify trends in readmissions and high-risk cases.
An administrator audits the discharge process to ensure compliance with healthcare regulations.
2. Functional Requirements
Core Features:

Centralized discharge planning dashboard for medical staff.
Automated generation of patient-friendly discharge summaries in multiple languages.
Appointment scheduling with outpatient care providers.
Alerts and reminders for follow-up care and medication adherence.
Analytics and reporting tools to track discharge outcomes and readmission rates.
Authentication Conditions & Frequency:

Users authenticate at the start of every session.
Re-authentication required after 20 minutes of inactivity.
High-sensitivity actions, such as modifying patient care plans or generating compliance reports, require re-authentication.
Sensitivity of Actions & Permission Levels:

High Sensitivity: Editing discharge plans, modifying medication reconciliation, and accessing compliance reports. Restricted to physicians and discharge coordinators.
Moderate Sensitivity: Viewing discharge summaries and scheduling appointments. Accessible to nurses and medical staff.
Low Sensitivity: Viewing reminders and follow-up instructions. Accessible to patients and family members.
3. Non-Functional Requirements
Performance:

System response time under 2 seconds for data retrieval and 5 seconds for generating discharge summaries.
Support up to 2,000 concurrent users during peak discharge hours.
Scalability:

Scale to accommodate a 50% increase in user base over 5 years, including new hospital networks.
Reliability:

99.9% uptime with automated failover to prevent disruptions during critical workflows.
Daily backups with a recovery time of 4 hours in case of system failure.
Security:

Role-based access control with audit trails for all user actions.
End-to-end encryption for all patient data transmissions and storage.
Usability:

Intuitive, role-specific interfaces for staff and patients.
Accessibility features for visually and hearing-impaired users.
Audit & Monitoring:

Comprehensive logs for user activities, accessible by compliance officers for audits.
Weekly reports on readmission rates and discharge compliance generated automatically.
4. Constraints
Technical Constraints:

Must integrate with existing EHR systems and pharmacy management platforms.
Limited offline functionality for patient reminders due to reliance on real-time cloud synchronization.
Compliance Requirements:

HIPAA compliance for protecting patient information.
Adherence to CMS (Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services) guidelines for hospital discharge processes.
Resource Constraints:

Budget: $6 million allocated over 18 months, including development, integration, and testing costs.
Staffing: A team of 25, including project managers, developers, QA testers, healthcare domain experts, and support staff.
Timeframe: 18 months, with a 4-month buffer to address unforeseen delays.
Integration Needs:

Seamless interoperability with hospital EHR systems and appointment scheduling systems.
Real-time data synchronization with third-party pharmacy services for medication reconciliation.
