1. System Overview
System Purpose:
The system, Telehealth Consultation and Monitoring Platform (TCMP), is designed to enable remote patient consultations, real-time health monitoring, and chronic disease management. It aims to improve accessibility to healthcare services for rural and underserved populations while ensuring timely intervention through continuous monitoring of patient health metrics.

Domain/Context:
Healthcare, focusing on telemedicine and remote health monitoring, particularly for patients managing chronic illnesses such as diabetes, hypertension, and heart disease.

Stakeholders:

Primary Users: Physicians, nurses, and remote healthcare specialists.
Secondary Users: Patients in rural areas and their families.
Administrative Users: Health system administrators and compliance officers.
User Base Characteristics:

Approximately 20,000 users, including:
3,000 healthcare providers across telehealth networks.
15,000 patients enrolled in remote monitoring programs.
2,000 administrative users ensuring compliance and system management.
Distributed across urban, rural, and remote regions.
Roles include clinical decision-makers, administrative compliance personnel, and end-user patients.
Operational Environment:

Cloud-hosted system accessible via web and mobile applications.
Patients use the system through a mobile app integrated with wearable devices for real-time health data collection.
Providers and administrators access the system via secure hospital networks or remote access tools.
Usage Scenarios:

A patient's wearable device uploads real-time glucose levels, which trigger alerts to their assigned care team if readings deviate from safe ranges.
A doctor conducts a video consultation with a patient, reviews uploaded ECG data, and adjusts medications accordingly.
A compliance officer audits system logs to ensure HIPAA and regulatory adherence for telehealth sessions.
An administrator generates reports to evaluate system performance and patient outcomes.
2. Functional Requirements
Core Features:

Telehealth video consultations with integrated chat and document sharing.
Real-time monitoring of health metrics from wearables (e.g., heart rate, glucose levels, blood pressure).
Automated alerts for anomalous health readings.
Secure messaging between patients and providers.
Reporting and analytics tools for patient outcomes and compliance tracking.
Authentication Conditions & Frequency:

Authentication required at the beginning of every session.
Re-authentication required after 30 minutes of inactivity.
Re-authentication required for high-sensitivity actions, such as updating medication plans or generating audit reports.
Sensitivity of Actions & Permission Levels:

High Sensitivity: Adjusting patient care plans, accessing raw wearable data, and conducting telehealth consultations. Restricted to healthcare providers.
Moderate Sensitivity: Viewing patient history, sending messages, and receiving alerts. Accessible to healthcare providers and authorized caregivers.
Low Sensitivity: Viewing personal health metrics or communication summaries. Accessible to patients.
3. Non-Functional Requirements
Performance:

Average response time under 3 seconds for real-time monitoring and data retrieval.
Support up to 5,000 concurrent video consultation sessions during peak usage.
Scalability:

Handle a 100% increase in user base and wearable device connections within 2 years.
Reliability:

99.95% system uptime with automated failover for telehealth sessions.
Daily backups and recovery of health data within 2 hours in case of failure.
Security:

End-to-end encryption for telehealth sessions and data transmissions.
Strict role-based access control with logging for all user actions.
Usability:

Mobile-first design for patients with simple navigation and multi-language support.
Training modules for providers on how to manage telehealth sessions and wearable integrations.
Audit & Monitoring:

Comprehensive logs for user actions, with weekly and on-demand audit reporting.
Real-time monitoring of system performance and anomaly detection.
4. Constraints
Technical Constraints:

Must integrate with widely-used wearable devices (e.g., Fitbit, Apple Watch) via standard APIs.
Limited offline functionality for wearable device data uploads due to cloud dependency.
Compliance Requirements:

HIPAA for patient data security and privacy.
FDA compliance for any recommendations or algorithms based on medical device data.
Resource Constraints:

Budget: $8 million allocated over 2 years, including hardware, development, and testing costs.
Staffing: A 30-member team, including developers, QA testers, healthcare domain experts, and support staff.
Timeframe: 24 months for development and deployment, with a 6-month buffer for unforeseen delays.
Integration Needs:

Interoperability with existing hospital EHR systems for seamless patient record updates.
Integration with wearable device APIs for real-time data collection and analytics.
