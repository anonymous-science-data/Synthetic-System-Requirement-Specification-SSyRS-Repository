Healthcare System Requirements Scenario
1. System Overview
System Purpose:
The system is designed to support chronic disease management by providing a centralized platform for patient monitoring, data collection, and care coordination. Its objectives are to improve patient outcomes through real-time data sharing, reduce hospital readmissions, and enable proactive interventions.

Domain/Context:
The system operates in the healthcare sector, focusing on chronic conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, and respiratory disorders.

Stakeholders:

Primary: Physicians, care coordinators, and patients with chronic conditions.
Secondary: Family members, health insurance providers, and compliance officers.
User Base Characteristics:

Size: Approximately 15,000 active users initially, with an anticipated growth to 50,000 users within five years.
Diversity: Users include patients with varying levels of tech proficiency, care coordinators managing multiple patients, and physicians requiring advanced analytics.
Geographic Distribution: System deployment spans urban and rural areas, with specific focus on underserved regions to reduce health disparities.
2. Functional Requirements
Core Features:

Remote Patient Monitoring: Integration with wearable devices to track vital signs such as blood pressure, glucose levels, and heart rate.
Alerts and Notifications: Automated alerts for healthcare providers when patient vitals exceed predefined thresholds.
Care Plan Management: Tools for creating, updating, and tracking patient-specific care plans.
Analytics and Reporting: Dashboards for trend analysis and risk stratification.
Patient Portal: A user-friendly interface for patients to view their data, schedule appointments, and communicate with care teams.
Frequency of Authentication:

Users authenticate once per session, with session timeouts after 30 minutes of inactivity.
Sensitive actions, such as updating care plans or accessing historical patient data, require reauthentication.
Sensitivity of Actions:

High Sensitivity: Modifying care plans, viewing historical patient data, and overriding alert thresholds.
Moderate Sensitivity: Viewing real-time patient vitals and analytics.
Low Sensitivity: Accessing educational resources or general system updates.
3. Non-Functional Requirements
Performance:

System must process and display real-time vitals data with a latency of no more than 2 seconds.
Must support at least 1,000 concurrent users during peak times.
Scalability:

Capable of scaling to support a 5x increase in both users and data volume over five years.
Reliability:

Uptime of 99.9% with failover mechanisms to handle wearable device integration disruptions.
Recovery from critical failures within 1 hour to ensure continuity of care.
Security:

End-to-end encryption of all data, both in transit (TLS 1.3) and at rest (AES-256).
Role-based access control (RBAC) to limit data access based on user roles.
Multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all users accessing sensitive data or performing high-sensitivity actions.
Usability:

Designed for accessibility with WCAG 2.1 compliance, supporting users with visual, cognitive, or physical impairments.
Includes tutorial modules for patients unfamiliar with technology.
4. Constraints
Technical Constraints:

Must integrate with existing EHR systems, as well as popular wearable device APIs (e.g., Apple HealthKit, Fitbit API).
Cloud-based infrastructure using AWS for scalability and reliability.
Compliance Requirements:

Full compliance with HIPAA, as well as FDA regulations for software handling medical device data.
Adherence to data localization laws, ensuring patient data is stored within U.S. borders.
Resource Constraints:

Budget capped at $4 million for initial development and deployment, with a 20-month timeline.
Limited availability of in-house staff for integration, necessitating external vendor partnerships.
Integration Needs:

Seamless integration with telehealth platforms to enable virtual consultations.
Support for interoperability with health insurance systems to streamline claims processing.
This scenario presents a realistic healthcare system tailored for chronic disease management, addressing industry challenges, user diversity, and operational constraints.
