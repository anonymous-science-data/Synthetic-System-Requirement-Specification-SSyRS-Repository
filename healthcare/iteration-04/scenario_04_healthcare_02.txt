Healthcare System Requirements Scenario
1. System Overview
System Purpose:
The system is designed to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of medication management in hospitals and outpatient clinics. Its primary objectives are to minimize medication errors, improve prescription processing, and ensure compliance with regulatory standards.

Domain/Context:
The system operates in the healthcare sector, focusing on medication management, prescription workflows, and patient safety.

Stakeholders:

Primary: Pharmacists, physicians, nurses, and hospital administrators.
Secondary: Patients, compliance officers, IT administrators, and health regulators.
User Base Characteristics:

Size: Initial user base of 5,000 healthcare professionals, scalable to 20,000 within three years.
Diversity: Users include pharmacists in centralized pharmacies, physicians prescribing medications, and nurses handling bedside medication administration.
Geographic Distribution: The system is deployed across urban and suburban hospitals and clinics within a regional healthcare network.
2. Functional Requirements
Core Features:

Prescription Management Module: Real-time validation of prescriptions against patient history and known drug interactions.
Inventory Tracking: Automated stock updates and alerts for low inventory.
Decision Support Tools: Recommendations for generic drug alternatives and dosage adjustments based on patient data.
Audit Trail: Comprehensive logging of all actions related to prescriptions and medication dispensing for compliance purposes.
Frequency of Authentication:

Users authenticate at the start of each shift, with session timeouts after 15 minutes of inactivity.
Reauthentication is required for sensitive actions, such as approving high-risk medications or overriding alerts.
Sensitivity of Actions:

High Sensitivity: Approving restricted medications, modifying patient records, or overriding drug interaction alerts.
Moderate Sensitivity: Updating inventory or accessing prescription histories.
Low Sensitivity: Viewing general system usage reports or non-sensitive data.
3. Non-Functional Requirements
Performance:

Prescription validation must occur within 1 second for seamless workflow integration.
The system must support 300 concurrent users during peak hours without noticeable delays.
Scalability:

The architecture must support a 4x increase in users and transactions over the next three years.
Reliability:

The system must maintain 99.95% uptime, with failover mechanisms to ensure uninterrupted access during hardware failures.
Data recovery should be completed within 30 minutes of a system outage.
Security:

All data must be encrypted at rest and in transit using industry standards (AES-256, TLS 1.3).
Role-based access control (RBAC) and multi-factor authentication (MFA) are mandatory for all users.
Usability:

The interface should support quick navigation for high-frequency tasks, with minimal training required for end users.
Accessibility standards (e.g., WCAG 2.1) must be met to accommodate users with disabilities.
4. Constraints
Technical Constraints:

Must integrate seamlessly with existing hospital EHR systems using FHIR standards.
On-premise deployment with cloud backup for disaster recovery purposes.
Compliance Requirements:

Adherence to HIPAA, regional controlled substance regulations, and FDA guidelines for medication management systems.
Resource Constraints:

The development budget is $5 million, with a go-live timeline of 24 months.
Limited in-house IT resources necessitate third-party support for integration and deployment.
Integration Needs:

Integration with existing pharmacy management systems and health insurance platforms to automate reimbursement workflows.
This scenario is tailored to address medication management challenges in healthcare while considering the specific constraints and requirements of the domain.
