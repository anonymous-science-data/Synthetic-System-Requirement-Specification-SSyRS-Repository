Healthcare Software System Requirements Scenario
1. System Overview
System Purpose:
The system is designed to optimize the coordination of care for patients with chronic conditions by integrating patient records, enabling remote monitoring, and automating notifications to patients and care teams. Its goal is to improve patient outcomes while reducing administrative overhead.

Domain/Context:
Chronic disease management in outpatient healthcare settings. The system supports care teams in providing timely interventions and personalized care plans.

Stakeholders:

Primary Stakeholders: Care teams (e.g., physicians, nurses, care coordinators), administrative staff, and patients with chronic conditions.
Secondary Stakeholders: Insurance providers and regulatory bodies.
Other Stakeholders: IT administrators managing system operations and security.
User Base Characteristics:

Size: Approximately 3,500 active users, including 700 healthcare providers, 300 administrative staff, and 2,500 patients.
Diversity: Users include highly trained medical staff, administrative personnel, and patients with varying levels of technological literacy.
Geographic Distribution: Patients and providers are concentrated within a regional healthcare network spanning multiple cities.
Roles: Providers (access and update records, monitor patient status), administrative staff (schedule and manage patient data), and patients (view care plans, receive reminders).
Operational Environment:
The system is hosted in a secure cloud environment with compliance certifications for healthcare data. It is accessed via a web portal and a mobile app, with offline functionality for rural providers with limited connectivity.

Usage Scenarios:

Providers receive automated alerts for patients at risk of health deterioration based on remote monitoring device data.
Patients update self-reported metrics (e.g., blood pressure) via the mobile app.
Administrative staff schedule follow-ups and coordinate virtual consultations.
2. Functional Requirements
Core Features:

Patient Monitoring Integration: Real-time integration with wearables and medical devices to capture patient metrics.
Care Plan Management: Tools for creating, assigning, and tracking personalized care plans.
Communication Module: Secure messaging between patients and providers.
Appointment Management: Online scheduling for in-person or virtual visits.
Authentication Conditions & Frequency:

Authentication is required upon login and after 15 minutes of inactivity.
Re-authentication is mandatory for accessing sensitive actions, such as updating care plans or downloading patient records.
Sensitivity of Actions & Permission Levels:

High Sensitivity: Editing care plans, reviewing device data trends (providers only).
Moderate Sensitivity: Scheduling appointments and updating basic patient information (administrative staff).
Low Sensitivity: Viewing care plans and general reminders (patients).
3. Non-Functional Requirements
Performance:

The system must handle up to 1,000 concurrent users with a maximum response time of 3 seconds for 95% of actions.
Scalability:

Designed to scale to support 10,000 users, accommodating regional network growth and additional data from monitoring devices.
Reliability:

99.95% uptime, with mechanisms for automatic failover and nightly backups for data recovery.
System should recover from downtime within 10 minutes.
Security:

Data encryption in transit and at rest.
Role-based access control and periodic security audits.
Usability:

Simple interfaces for non-technical users, including guided workflows for patients.
Mobile app design adheres to accessibility standards for older patients.
Audit & Monitoring:

Complete logging of system events, including access to sensitive data and failed authentication attempts.
Audit trails must be accessible for six years to meet compliance requirements.
4. Constraints
Technical Constraints:

Must integrate with existing EHR systems and device APIs from multiple manufacturers.
Operates on AWS Cloud with region-specific data centers to comply with local data residency laws.
Compliance Requirements:

Full HIPAA compliance for patient data privacy and security.
System must meet FDA guidelines for handling data from medical devices.
Resource Constraints:

Budget: $3.5 million, with $750,000 allocated for post-launch support and scaling.
Timeline: 24 months for development and deployment, including a 4-month buffer for testing and addressing compliance reviews.
Team Size: 25 developers, 6 QA engineers, 3 compliance experts, 4 data integration specialists, and 3 project managers.
Integration Needs:

Seamless integration with existing telehealth platforms and patient monitoring devices.
Synchronization with insurance systems to support automated claim submissions for chronic care services.
This scenario reflects a realistic, industry-aligned approach to developing a chronic care management system, accounting for technical, regulatory, and operational considerations. It ensures sufficient resources for a robust, compliant, and scalable solution.
