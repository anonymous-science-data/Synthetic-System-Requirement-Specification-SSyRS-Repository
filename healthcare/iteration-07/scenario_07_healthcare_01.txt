Healthcare Software System Requirements Scenario

1. System Overview
System Purpose:
The system is designed to streamline the management of patient appointments, medical records, and billing processes for a mid-sized healthcare provider network. Its primary objective is to improve operational efficiency, enhance patient engagement, and ensure compliance with healthcare regulations like HIPAA.

Domain/Context:
Healthcare administration, focusing on clinics and outpatient care facilities. The system bridges the gap between administrative staff, healthcare providers, and patients.

Stakeholders:

Primary Stakeholders: Healthcare administrators, medical practitioners, and billing staff.
Secondary Stakeholders: Patients and insurance representatives.
Regulatory Bodies: Ensuring system compliance with healthcare regulations.
User Base Characteristics:

Size: ~2,000 active users, including 500 administrative staff, 400 practitioners, and 1,100 patients.
Diversity: Users range from technologically proficient administrative staff to less tech-savvy medical practitioners and patients.
Geographic Distribution: The system supports multiple clinics within a single state.
Roles: Patients (view and update information), administrative staff (manage schedules, records, and billing), practitioners (update and access patient records), and IT administrators.
Operational Environment:
The system will be cloud-based, with access available through web and mobile applications. It supports on-premise clinics with intermittent internet access through offline modes.

Usage Scenarios:

Patients book or reschedule appointments via the mobile app.
Practitioners view and update medical records during consultations.
Administrative staff manage patient schedules, billing, and insurance claims.
IT administrators monitor access logs and address system issues.
2. Functional Requirements
Core Features:

Patient Appointment Management: Online scheduling, reminders, and rescheduling.
Medical Records Management: Secure storage and retrieval of patient records, with support for multimedia (e.g., imaging).
Billing and Insurance: Automated billing, insurance claim generation, and payment tracking.
Patient Portal: A dashboard for patients to view their health history, appointments, and billing status.
Authentication Conditions & Frequency:

Session-based authentication, with sessions expiring after 30 minutes of inactivity.
Re-authentication required for sensitive actions such as modifying medical records, billing details, or accessing patient history.
Patients authenticate at login and upon accessing specific sensitive features like prescription details.
Sensitivity of Actions & Permission Levels:

High Sensitivity: Modifying medical records (practitioners only), accessing billing data (admin staff only).
Moderate Sensitivity: Booking/rescheduling appointments (patients, admin staff).
Low Sensitivity: Viewing health tips and announcements (patients).
3. Non-Functional Requirements
Performance:

Response times must not exceed 2 seconds for 95% of operations.
Must handle up to 500 concurrent users without degradation.
Scalability:

Designed to support future expansion to 5,000 active users.
Storage capacity should grow dynamically to accommodate increasing medical records and billing data.
Reliability:

99.9% uptime, with failover systems in place for data access continuity.
Data recovery should occur within 15 minutes of a system outage.
Security:

Encryption of data at rest and in transit.
Role-based access control for all sensitive features.
Regular security patches and vulnerability assessments.
Usability:

The system must be accessible to users with limited technical proficiency.
Mobile app and web interfaces must be intuitive, with task-oriented navigation.
Audit & Monitoring:

Detailed logging of user actions, especially access to and modification of sensitive data.
Alerts for failed login attempts and other suspicious activities.
4. Constraints
Technical Constraints:

Must integrate with existing EHR (Electronic Health Record) systems used by clinics.
Operates on a cloud platform certified for healthcare use (e.g., AWS Health).
Compliance Requirements:

Full adherence to HIPAA and state-level healthcare regulations.
Patient data localization within state borders.
Resource Constraints:

Budget: $2 million for development, including $500,000 for scalability enhancements post-launch.
Timeline: 18 months for development and initial deployment, including a 3-month buffer for unexpected delays.
Team: 20 developers, 5 QA specialists, 2 compliance officers, and 3 project managers.
Integration Needs:

Interfaces with existing insurance and billing platforms.
Synchronization with telehealth systems used by practitioners.
This scenario reflects a practical and robust approach to designing a healthcare software system, ensuring alignment with industry challenges and regulatory demands while planning for scalability and ease of use.
