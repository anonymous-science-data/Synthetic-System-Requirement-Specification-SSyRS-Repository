Healthcare Software System Requirements Scenario
1. System Overview
System Purpose:
The system is designed to enable seamless care coordination and centralized patient data management for pediatric clinics. Its primary goal is to enhance care quality, reduce administrative effort, and support adherence to child-specific healthcare compliance standards.

Domain/Context:
Pediatric care management within outpatient and community healthcare settings. The system focuses on integrating health records, appointment scheduling, and vaccination tracking.

Stakeholders:

Primary Stakeholders: Pediatricians, nurses, and clinic administrative staff.
Secondary Stakeholders: Parents/guardians of pediatric patients, compliance officers, and state health departments.
Other Stakeholders: IT support staff maintaining the system.
User Base Characteristics:

Size: ~1,800 users, including 300 clinical staff, 200 administrative personnel, and 1,300 parents/guardians.
Diversity: Users range from highly technical IT staff to non-technical parents accessing the system.
Geographic Distribution: Clinics and users are concentrated in suburban and rural regions, often with intermittent internet access.
Roles: Pediatricians (access/update records, track growth metrics), administrators (manage schedules and billing), and parents (view vaccination schedules, book appointments).
Operational Environment:
The system will be a hybrid solution hosted on a secure cloud platform, with offline access for clinics in areas with unstable internet. Parents and guardians will access a web portal or mobile app for updates and appointments.

Usage Scenarios:

Pediatricians log growth metrics and immunization records during consultations.
Parents use the app to book well-child visits and receive automated reminders for upcoming vaccinations.
Administrative staff coordinate clinic schedules and track insurance claims.
2. Functional Requirements
Core Features:

Patient Growth and Immunization Tracking: Automated tools to track growth metrics and vaccination schedules, with alerts for overdue immunizations.
Appointment and Calendar Management: Online scheduling for in-person and virtual visits, with automated reminders.
Parent Portal: Secure portal for parents to view health milestones, immunization schedules, and medical visit history.
Compliance Dashboard: Tools for administrators to generate compliance reports for state health agencies.
Authentication Conditions & Frequency:

Authentication required at login and after 20 minutes of inactivity.
Re-authentication required for sensitive actions, such as downloading patient records or modifying compliance data.
Sensitivity of Actions & Permission Levels:

High Sensitivity: Editing patient growth and vaccination records (pediatricians only).
Moderate Sensitivity: Viewing compliance reports and patient contact details (administrative staff).
Low Sensitivity: Booking appointments or viewing reminders (parents/guardians).
3. Non-Functional Requirements
Performance:

The system must support up to 500 concurrent users with response times under 2.5 seconds for 95% of operations.
Scalability:

Scalability to accommodate 4,000 users, ensuring readiness for clinic expansions and partnerships with regional healthcare networks.
Reliability:

99.9% uptime with automated failover systems and weekly backups for disaster recovery.
The system must recover from outages within 15 minutes.
Security:

Data encryption for all stored and transmitted data.
Role-based access controls with regular security patches.
Usability:

Designed to accommodate parents with limited technical literacy, with simple navigation and language localization for non-native English speakers.
Audit & Monitoring:

Detailed logs for all user actions, particularly modifications to medical and compliance data.
Automated alerts for suspicious login attempts or access anomalies.
4. Constraints
Technical Constraints:

Must integrate with existing EHR platforms used by clinics.
Offline access must support data synchronization once connectivity is restored.
Compliance Requirements:

Full adherence to HIPAA regulations and pediatric-specific guidelines from state health departments.
Resource Constraints:

Budget: $3 million, including $600,000 reserved for post-launch scaling and maintenance.
Timeline: 22 months, with a 4-month buffer for compliance review and integration testing.
Team Size: 22 developers, 5 QA engineers, 2 compliance experts, 3 data integration specialists, and 4 project managers.
Integration Needs:

Interfaces with state immunization registries and billing platforms for insurance claims.
Compatibility with telehealth platforms for virtual pediatric consultations.
This scenario is designed to address pediatric care management challenges while reflecting realistic timeframes, budget, and resource allocation within the healthcare domain.
