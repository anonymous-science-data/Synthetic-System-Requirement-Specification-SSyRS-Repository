Healthcare Software System Scenario: Electronic Medication Management System (EMMS)
1. System Overview
System Purpose:
The Electronic Medication Management System (EMMS) is designed to enhance patient safety and streamline medication workflows in healthcare facilities. Its primary goal is to reduce medication errors, improve adherence to prescribed treatment regimens, and provide comprehensive reporting on medication administration.

Domain/Context:
The EMMS operates in the healthcare domain, serving hospitals, clinics, and long-term care facilities. It aligns with the industry's focus on patient-centric care, regulatory compliance, and interoperability with other healthcare systems.

Stakeholders:

Healthcare Providers: Physicians, nurses, and pharmacists who prescribe, administer, and verify medications.
Patients: Beneficiaries of accurate and timely medication delivery.
Hospital Administrators: Oversee compliance, operational efficiency, and reporting.
Regulators: Ensure the system complies with healthcare standards like HIPAA and local medication safety guidelines.
IT Teams: Maintain the system's infrastructure, resolve technical issues, and manage integrations.
User Base Characteristics:

Approximately 2,000 active users per facility, including clinicians, pharmacists, and administrators.
Diverse roles with varying levels of technical expertise, ranging from tech-savvy hospital IT staff to less experienced nurses.
Geographically distributed across urban and rural healthcare facilities.
Operational Environment:
The system is hosted on a hybrid cloud infrastructure, providing secure access through web browsers and mobile applications. It supports on-premise deployment for facilities with specific compliance needs.

Usage Scenarios:

A physician enters a new medication order during rounds.
A nurse scans a patient's wristband to verify and administer medication.
A pharmacist reviews and validates medication orders for contraindications.
Administrators generate reports on medication errors and adherence.
2. Functional Requirements
Core Features:

Medication Ordering: Allows physicians to input and update prescriptions.
Barcode Scanning: Ensures patient- and medication-specific verifications during administration.
Drug Interaction Alerts: Provides real-time warnings for potential contraindications.
Medication Administration Record (MAR): Logs all administered medications with timestamps and user information.
Reporting Tools: Enables administrators to extract insights on medication workflows and compliance.
Authentication Conditions & Frequency:

Users authenticate at the start of each shift.
Sensitive actions, such as approving high-risk medications (e.g., opioids), require re-authentication.
Sessions expire after 8 hours of inactivity.
Sensitivity of Actions & Permission Levels:

High Sensitivity: Approving controlled substances (pharmacists), overriding drug interaction alerts (physicians).
Medium Sensitivity: Administering medications (nurses).
Low Sensitivity: Generating compliance reports (administrators).
Permission levels ensure only authorized users can perform specific tasks.
3. Non-Functional Requirements
Performance:

Must process medication orders within 2 seconds and support simultaneous usage by up to 500 users per facility.
Scalability:

Able to accommodate up to 50% growth in user base and transactions over five years.
Reliability:

Uptime of 99.9% with automated failover for critical components.
Automatic recovery from minor failures within 10 minutes.
Security:

Implements role-based access control (RBAC) and data encryption both at rest and in transit.
Regular security audits and penetration testing.
Usability:

Intuitive interfaces with contextual help for less tech-savvy users.
Supports screen readers for compliance with accessibility standards like WCAG.
Audit & Monitoring:

Logs all user actions involving medications, with timestamps and user details.
Provides real-time alerts for unusual activity, such as repeated overrides of drug interaction warnings.
4. Constraints
Technical Constraints:

Integration with existing Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems using HL7 or FHIR standards.
Must operate on devices with limited processing power, such as older barcode scanners.
Compliance Requirements:

Adheres to HIPAA for patient data protection.
Complies with Joint Commission medication management standards.
Resource Constraints:

Development budget capped at $3 million.
Implementation timeframe of 12 months, including pilot testing.
Integration Needs:

Seamlessly connects to hospital's EHR, pharmacy management systems, and inventory tracking platforms.
This scenario outlines a cohesive and realistic plan for developing and implementing the EMMS within the healthcare sector, addressing specific challenges and aligning with both operational and compliance requirements.
