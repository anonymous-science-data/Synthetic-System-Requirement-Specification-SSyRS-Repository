Healthcare Software System Scenario: Patient-Centered Appointment Management System (PCAMS)
1. System Overview
System Purpose:
The Patient-Centered Appointment Management System (PCAMS) aims to streamline appointment scheduling, reduce missed appointments, and enhance patient-provider communication. It is designed to improve patient engagement while optimizing clinic workflows.

Domain/Context:
PCAMS operates in the outpatient healthcare domain, serving clinics, diagnostic centers, and primary care facilities. The system focuses on improving operational efficiency and enhancing patient satisfaction.

Stakeholders:

Patients: Primary users scheduling, rescheduling, and canceling appointments.
Healthcare Providers: Physicians, nurses, and administrative staff managing schedules.
Administrators: Oversee scheduling efficiency, resource allocation, and patient feedback.
IT Teams: Maintain system functionality, resolve technical issues, and implement updates.
User Base Characteristics:

A diverse user base comprising approximately 5,000 patients and 200 healthcare staff per facility.
Patients include individuals of varying ages and technical literacy levels.
Healthcare staff includes front-desk personnel, clinicians, and schedulers.
Operational Environment:
The system is hosted on a secure cloud-based infrastructure accessible via web browsers and mobile applications. It offers offline capabilities for areas with intermittent connectivity.

Usage Scenarios:

A patient books a follow-up appointment using the mobile app.
Administrative staff adjust a physician's schedule to accommodate urgent cases.
A physician views their daily schedule, including patient details and medical history.
Automated reminders are sent to patients to reduce no-shows.
2. Functional Requirements
Core Features:

Appointment Scheduling: Allows patients to view and book available time slots.
Calendar Management: Enables healthcare staff to manage clinic schedules dynamically.
Automated Notifications: Sends appointment confirmations, reminders, and follow-ups to patients.
Patient Profiles: Stores basic patient information for quick access during scheduling.
Feedback Collection: Gathers patient feedback after appointments.
Authentication Conditions & Frequency:

Patients authenticate once per session, with sessions expiring after 30 minutes of inactivity.
Healthcare staff authenticate at the start of each shift, with re-authentication required for sensitive actions like modifying another provider's schedule.
Sensitivity of Actions & Permission Levels:

High Sensitivity: Modifying physician schedules (administrators and managers).
Medium Sensitivity: Booking appointments for patients (front-desk staff).
Low Sensitivity: Viewing one's schedule (physicians and patients).
Permissions ensure actions are role-specific and logged for accountability.
3. Non-Functional Requirements
Performance:

Response times for booking or rescheduling appointments must not exceed 2 seconds.
Supports concurrent usage by up to 500 users per facility during peak hours.
Scalability:

System must scale to support up to 10,000 patients and 500 staff members per facility over five years.
Reliability:

Achieve an uptime of 99.95% with automatic failover mechanisms.
Recovery from minor disruptions within 5 minutes.
Security:

Implement role-based access control and encrypt patient data at rest and in transit.
Conduct quarterly vulnerability assessments.
Usability:

Intuitive interface with minimal learning curve for patients.
Supports accessibility requirements, including screen readers and multi-language support.
Audit & Monitoring:

Logs all scheduling and rescheduling actions with timestamps and user details.
Provides dashboards for tracking no-show trends and schedule adjustments.
4. Constraints
Technical Constraints:

Must integrate with existing EHR systems using FHIR standards.
Offline capabilities must function with local data storage for up to 24 hours.
Compliance Requirements:

Comply with HIPAA regulations to protect patient data.
Adhere to accessibility standards such as WCAG for patient-facing interfaces.
Resource Constraints:

Development budget limited to $2.5 million.
Deployment across all facilities within 10 months, including staff training and testing.
Integration Needs:

Seamless integration with third-party calendar systems, EHRs, and notification platforms (e.g., SMS, email).
This scenario outlines the PCAMS solution with clear alignment to healthcare-specific challenges, operational goals, and compliance requirements, ensuring feasibility and effectiveness in addressing industry needs.
