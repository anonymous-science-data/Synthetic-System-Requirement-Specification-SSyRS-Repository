Healthcare Software System Scenario: Telehealth Management Platform (TMP)
1. System Overview
System Purpose:
The Telehealth Management Platform (TMP) is designed to facilitate virtual consultations, streamline scheduling, and improve patient access to healthcare services. Its goal is to reduce the barriers of distance and availability, especially for underserved populations.

Domain/Context:
TMP operates within the telemedicine domain, targeting outpatient services, specialist consultations, and follow-up care. The platform is aligned with the increasing adoption of remote healthcare delivery models in response to patient demand and cost efficiency.

Stakeholders:

Patients: Access healthcare providers through virtual appointments.
Healthcare Providers: Conduct consultations and manage patient records.
Administrators: Oversee operations, compliance, and system utilization.
IT Teams: Maintain the system's security, performance, and integrations.
User Base Characteristics:

Approximately 10,000 patients per system instance, spread across urban, suburban, and rural areas.
Healthcare staff includes 500 clinicians (general practitioners, specialists) and 50 administrators per system instance.
Patients vary in technical literacy, necessitating a simple, accessible interface.
Operational Environment:
The system is hosted on a secure cloud platform with a redundant data center for failover. It is accessible via web and mobile applications, optimized for both high-speed and low-bandwidth environments.

Usage Scenarios:

A patient books a virtual consultation with a specialist.
A clinician conducts a telehealth session, reviewing the patient's history and updating treatment plans.
Administrators monitor system performance and review patient feedback.
The platform sends automated reminders for appointments and follow-ups.
2. Functional Requirements
Core Features:

Virtual Consultations: Video and audio capabilities with secure patient-provider communication.
Appointment Scheduling: Tools for patients to book, reschedule, and cancel appointments.
Health Records Access: Allows providers to access and update patient records during consultations.
Automated Notifications: Sends reminders and follow-up messages to patients.
Feedback Collection: Enables patients to rate their telehealth experience and report issues.
Authentication Conditions & Frequency:

Patients authenticate at the beginning of each session.
Clinicians authenticate at the start of their shifts and re-authenticate before accessing patient records or starting a virtual session.
Sessions expire after 30 minutes of inactivity for patients and 2 hours for clinicians.
Sensitivity of Actions & Permission Levels:

High Sensitivity: Modifying patient records (clinicians, administrators).
Medium Sensitivity: Conducting virtual consultations (clinicians).
Low Sensitivity: Scheduling appointments (patients, staff).
Role-based permissions ensure security and data integrity.
3. Non-Functional Requirements
Performance:

Ensure video and audio latency is below 300 milliseconds for virtual consultations.
Support simultaneous usage by 1,000 active users during peak times.
Scalability:

The platform must handle a 50% increase in user volume over three years.
Cloud-based architecture allows for on-demand resource scaling.
Reliability:

System uptime of 99.9% with automated failover to a secondary data center.
Recovery from minor disruptions within 5 minutes.
Security:

Employ encryption for data in transit and at rest.
Implement role-based access controls and conduct regular penetration testing.
Usability:

User-friendly interface with large buttons, clear labels, and multilingual support.
Compatible with accessibility tools like screen readers and keyboard navigation.
Audit & Monitoring:

Logs all virtual session activity, patient record access, and appointment changes.
Real-time alerts for suspicious activities, such as multiple failed login attempts.
4. Constraints
Technical Constraints:

The platform must integrate with existing EHR systems using HL7 and FHIR standards.
Optimized for devices with limited processing power, such as older smartphones and tablets.
Compliance Requirements:

Adheres to HIPAA regulations for data protection.
Ensures WCAG compliance for accessibility in patient-facing interfaces.
Resource Constraints:

Development budget capped at $4 million.
Implementation and rollout to all supported facilities within 12 months.
Integration Needs:

Seamless integration with telehealth peripherals (e.g., blood pressure monitors, pulse oximeters) and third-party notification services (email, SMS).
This scenario outlines the Telehealth Management Platform with realistic goals, challenges, and constraints tailored to the healthcare domain, ensuring it aligns with industry demands and technical feasibility.
