1. System Overview

System Purpose:
The proposed system, "TeleHealth Connect," is a virtual care platform designed to facilitate remote patient consultations, diagnostic review, and treatment monitoring for rural and underserved populations. The system aims to improve healthcare access, reduce patient travel times, and provide continuity of care through telemedicine services, integrated diagnostic tools, and follow-up workflows.

Domain/Context:
The system operates in the telemedicine domain, focusing on enabling healthcare delivery in regions with limited healthcare facilities and provider availability, particularly in rural and remote areas.

Stakeholders:

    Primary Stakeholders: Patients, primary care physicians, specialists, and nurse practitioners.
    Secondary Stakeholders: Regional health authorities, IT support teams, and public health policymakers.

User Base Characteristics:

    Size: Small-to-medium initial user base of 5,000 users, with plans to expand to 50,000 users within five years.
    Diversity: Includes patients with limited digital literacy, healthcare providers across various specialties, and system administrators.
    Geographic Distribution: Primarily focused on rural regions in Sub-Saharan Africa, Southeast Asia, and rural North America.
    Roles: Patients, clinicians (e.g., doctors, nurses, specialists), system administrators, and regional health coordinators.

Operational Environment:
The system is a cloud-hosted platform, accessible via mobile applications, web browsers, and low-bandwidth video conferencing tools. Offline support is provided for recording consultations and updating medical records, with synchronization when connectivity is restored.

Usage Scenarios:

    A patient schedules a virtual consultation with a primary care physician for a follow-up visit.
    A specialist reviews diagnostic imaging uploaded by a regional clinician and provides treatment recommendations.
    A nurse conducts a remote monitoring session for a patient managing a chronic illness, recording vital signs and sharing updates with their care team.
    A public health coordinator accesses aggregated, anonymized data to track regional health trends.

2. Functional Requirements

Core Features:

    Virtual Consultations: High-quality video and audio communication with support for low-bandwidth environments.
    Diagnostic Tool Integration: Upload and review of diagnostic data, including lab results and imaging files.
    Appointment Management: Scheduling, rescheduling, and reminders for virtual consultations.
    Remote Monitoring: Integration with patient-operated devices, such as blood pressure cuffs and glucose monitors.
    Health Data Repository: Secure storage and retrieval of patient health records.
    Translation Support: Real-time language translation for consultations across multilingual regions.

Authentication Conditions & Frequency:

    Session expiration after 45 minutes of inactivity.
    Authentication required for initiating virtual consultations, accessing sensitive patient records, and uploading diagnostic data.

Sensitivity of Actions & Permission Levels:

    High Sensitivity: Accessing/updating patient records and diagnostic data (restricted to clinicians).
    Moderate Sensitivity: Scheduling consultations and viewing care history (patients, clinicians).
    Low Sensitivity: Viewing educational materials and general health trends (all users).

3. Non-Functional Requirements

Performance:

    System must support video consultations with latency below 300ms in low-bandwidth environments (down to 1 Mbps).
    Response times for data retrieval and uploads must not exceed 3 seconds.

Scalability:

    Support up to 50,000 users and 2,000 concurrent video consultations by year five.
    Allow modular integration for future expansion of diagnostic tools and regional health reporting capabilities.

Reliability:

    Minimum uptime of 99.9%, with real-time failover mechanisms to alternate data centers.
    Daily automatic backups and a disaster recovery plan with a maximum recovery time of 4 hours.

Security:

    End-to-end encryption for video consultations, data transfers, and storage.
    Role-based access control with granular permissions for different user roles.
    Regular vulnerability assessments and penetration testing.

Usability:

    Simplified user interfaces designed for low digital literacy levels.
    Support for multiple languages, with interfaces available in English, French, Swahili, and Tagalog.
    Mobile-first design with seamless access on low-cost Android devices.

Audit & Monitoring:

    Comprehensive logging of all user actions, including session start/end times and data access.
    Regional health authorities to receive monthly compliance reports and audit summaries.

4. Constraints

Technical Constraints:

    Must operate efficiently on devices with limited processing power and memory, such as low-cost smartphones.
    Video consultation quality must dynamically adjust to varying network conditions.

Compliance Requirements:

    Must comply with GDPR for European users and align with local health data regulations in other regions.
    Adherence to WHO guidelines for telemedicine and remote diagnostics.

Resource Constraints:

    Initial development budget capped at $3 million, with a phased rollout over 24 months.
    A dedicated team of 25 members, including software developers, UX designers, healthcare consultants, and compliance specialists.

Integration Needs:

    Seamless integration with existing health information systems and diagnostic devices (e.g., DICOM viewers for imaging files).

This scenario reflects a realistic and distinct approach to addressing healthcare challenges in underserved regions, leveraging best practices in telemedicine and healthcare software design.
