1. System Overview

System Purpose:
The proposed system, "CarePath Optimization Suite," is an AI-powered clinical decision support system designed to optimize patient care pathways for surgical and non-surgical treatments. The system aims to reduce treatment delays, minimize hospital stays, and improve patient outcomes by leveraging predictive analytics and real-time data integration across departments.

Domain/Context:
The system operates in the hospital and clinic management domain, focusing on care coordination for medium to large healthcare facilities managing high patient volumes and complex treatment plans.

Stakeholders:

    Primary Stakeholders: Physicians, surgeons, care coordinators, hospital administrators, and patients.
    Secondary Stakeholders: IT support teams, insurers, and accreditation organizations.

User Base Characteristics:

    Size: Medium-sized user base of 10,000 healthcare professionals and administrators initially, scaling up to 50,000 over five years.
    Diversity: Includes a range of roles such as general practitioners, specialists, nurses, and administrators, with varying levels of digital proficiency.
    Geographic Distribution: Users span across urban and semi-urban areas in North America, Western Europe, and Southeast Asia.
    Roles: Clinicians (e.g., physicians, surgeons), support staff (e.g., nurses, care coordinators), and administrative users (e.g., hospital administrators, data analysts).

Operational Environment:
The system is cloud-hosted with an edge computing component for processing sensitive data locally in compliance with regional privacy regulations. It is accessible via web portals for desktops and tablets and includes mobile applications for quick updates by physicians on the go.

Usage Scenarios:

    A physician receives AI-generated recommendations for diagnostic tests and treatment plans based on the patient’s medical history and current symptoms.
    A hospital administrator reviews patient flow analytics and adjusts staff allocation for peak periods.
    A care coordinator monitors surgical patients’ post-discharge recovery data and flags anomalies for follow-up.
    A surgeon views real-time updates on resource availability in the operating room.

2. Functional Requirements

Core Features:

    AI-Driven Decision Support: Real-time recommendations for diagnostics, treatment plans, and resource allocation.
    Integrated Scheduling System: Coordination of operating rooms, diagnostic equipment, and specialist consultations.
    Predictive Analytics Dashboard: Insights into patient flow, resource utilization, and predicted recovery outcomes.
    Post-Discharge Monitoring: Integration with wearable devices to track patient vitals and recovery progress.
    Real-Time Alerts: Notifications for critical changes in patient conditions or resource availability.
    Customizable Workflows: Tailored dashboards and workflows for different roles (e.g., surgeon vs. administrator).

Authentication Conditions & Frequency:

    Re-authentication required after 60 minutes of inactivity.
    Immediate re-authentication triggered when accessing high-sensitivity data, such as surgical schedules or patient records.

Sensitivity of Actions & Permission Levels:

    High Sensitivity: Modifying treatment plans, scheduling surgeries (restricted to physicians and surgeons).
    Moderate Sensitivity: Viewing patient flow dashboards, updating recovery data (accessible to clinicians and coordinators).
    Low Sensitivity: Accessing training materials or general system reports (accessible to all users).

3. Non-Functional Requirements

Performance:

    System must maintain a response time of under 2 seconds for 90% of user actions.
    Predictive analytics dashboards must generate results within 5 seconds for data-intensive queries.

Scalability:

    Support up to 50,000 users and 10,000 concurrent transactions by year five.
    Allow modular expansion to include additional hospital departments or integrate with third-party diagnostic tools.

Reliability:

    Minimum uptime of 99.9%, with automated failover to redundant systems during outages.
    Backup and disaster recovery processes with a maximum recovery time of 2 hours.

Security:

    Data encryption for all data at rest and in transit.
    Region-specific data residency rules to ensure compliance with GDPR, HIPAA, and other privacy regulations.
    Role-based access control with audit trails for all data modifications.

Usability:

    Intuitive user interfaces optimized for touch-based devices like tablets.
    Multilingual support for English, Spanish, French, and Mandarin.
    Accessibility features to comply with WCAG 2.1 standards.

Audit & Monitoring:

    Logs for all user actions, including changes to patient records and scheduling.
    Monthly audit reports for compliance and incident tracking.

4. Constraints

Technical Constraints:

    Must integrate seamlessly with existing EHR systems (e.g., Epic, Cerner).
    AI processing for decision support must comply with regional infrastructure limitations in low-connectivity areas.

Compliance Requirements:

    Full compliance with HIPAA, GDPR, and local regulations for Southeast Asian regions.
    Certifications for AI-driven decision-making systems, such as ISO 13485 for medical devices.

Resource Constraints:

    Initial budget capped at $6 million, with phased development and rollout over 30 months.
    A dedicated team of 35 members, including AI specialists, healthcare consultants, software engineers, and UX designers.

Integration Needs:

    API-based integration with wearable devices and diagnostic imaging systems.
    Compatibility with hospital resource management software for scheduling and inventory tracking.

This scenario is distinct, realistic, and aligned with the challenges and goals of implementing AI-powered clinical decision support systems in the healthcare domain. It incorporates diverse user needs, operational environments, and geographic considerations while adhering to domain-specific regulations and standards.
