1. System Overview

System Purpose:
The proposed system, "CarePlan Navigator," is a comprehensive patient-centric care coordination platform designed to streamline care plans for chronic disease management. The system aims to improve communication and collaboration between healthcare providers, patients, and caregivers, ensuring personalized, consistent, and efficient delivery of care. It supports features such as care plan tracking, appointment scheduling, medication adherence monitoring, and secure messaging.

Domain/Context:
The system operates in the healthcare domain, with a focus on chronic disease management for conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, and COPD. It is tailored for use in a variety of healthcare settings, including outpatient clinics, hospitals, and home health services.

Stakeholders:

    Primary Stakeholders: Patients, physicians, care coordinators, nurses, and patient caregivers.
    Secondary Stakeholders: Hospital administrators, insurance providers, regulatory agencies, and IT support teams.

User Base Characteristics:

    Size: Medium-sized user base of approximately 15,000 users initially, with scalability up to 100,000 users over three years.
    Diversity: Includes patients with varying levels of digital literacy, healthcare providers with different specialties, and caregivers with diverse roles.
    Geographic Distribution: Users are distributed across three regions: the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom.
    Roles: Patients, caregivers, healthcare professionals (physicians, nurses, care coordinators), and system administrators.

Operational Environment:
The system is cloud-based, accessible via web browsers and mobile applications (iOS and Android). It integrates with wearable health devices for real-time data collection and supports offline access with automatic synchronization when the internet is available.

Usage Scenarios:

    A patient logs in to review their care plan, confirm upcoming appointments, and receive reminders for medication.
    A nurse updates a patient's care plan based on the latest test results and shares secure messages with the patient.
    A caregiver monitors the patient’s progress and communicates with the care team.
    A physician reviews aggregated patient data from wearable devices and modifies treatment recommendations.

2. Functional Requirements

Core Features:

    Care Plan Management: Tools for creating, updating, and monitoring personalized care plans.
    Secure Messaging: HIPAA-compliant communication between patients, caregivers, and providers.
    Appointment Scheduling: Integration with providers’ calendars for seamless scheduling and reminders.
    Medication Tracking: Alerts and adherence tracking for prescribed medications.
    Data Integration: Real-time health data collection from wearable devices like blood glucose monitors and smartwatches.
    Analytics Dashboard: Reports for providers to track patient progress and adherence trends.

Authentication Conditions & Frequency:

    Session-based authentication, requiring re-authentication after 30 minutes of inactivity.
    Additional authentication for sensitive actions, such as viewing or updating medical records or care plans.

Sensitivity of Actions & Permission Levels:

    High Sensitivity: Viewing/updating medical records (physicians, nurses).
    Moderate Sensitivity: Messaging and appointment scheduling (patients, caregivers).
    Low Sensitivity: Viewing reminders or educational materials (all users).

3. Non-Functional Requirements

Performance:

    System must maintain a response time of under 2 seconds for 95% of user interactions.
    Support concurrent usage by up to 1,000 active users without performance degradation.

Scalability:

    Must scale to accommodate a 5x increase in users and data volume over five years.
    Dynamic resource allocation to handle peak usage during early mornings and evenings.

Reliability:

    Minimum uptime of 99.95% with failover mechanisms to ensure uninterrupted service.
    Automated daily backups and a disaster recovery plan with a maximum recovery time of 2 hours.

Security:

    End-to-end encryption for all data in transit and at rest.
    Role-based access controls to enforce user permissions.
    Regular security assessments and vulnerability patching.

Usability:

    Mobile and web interfaces designed with WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility standards.
    Multilingual support for English, French, and Spanish.
    Intuitive workflows tailored for users with low digital literacy.

Audit & Monitoring:

    Logs of all user actions, including login times, data access, and updates.
    Monthly audit reports for compliance and incident tracking.

4. Constraints

Technical Constraints:

    Integration with existing EHR systems such as Epic and Cerner.
    Limited offline functionality, with synchronization required within 48 hours of reconnection.

Compliance Requirements:

    Must comply with HIPAA (United States), PIPEDA (Canada), and GDPR (European Union).
    Adherence to ISO/IEC 27001 for information security management.

Resource Constraints:

    Development budget capped at $5 million, with a timeline of 18 months for initial rollout.
    Dedicated team of 30 members, including software developers, healthcare consultants, UX designers, and testers.

Integration Needs:

    Seamless integration with third-party systems, including wearable device APIs and insurance provider portals.

This scenario reflects realistic challenges and objectives in the healthcare domain while ensuring adherence to best practices and diverse requirements.
