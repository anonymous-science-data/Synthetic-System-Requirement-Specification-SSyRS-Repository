Healthcare System Scenario: AI-Driven Patient Triage and Care Coordination Platform
1. System Overview
System Purpose:
To provide an AI-powered platform for patient triage and care coordination, enabling faster response times for urgent medical needs, efficient resource allocation, and seamless communication between healthcare providers.

Domain/Context:
The healthcare sector, focusing on emergency care, outpatient services, and care team collaboration.

Stakeholders:

Patients seeking medical care, particularly in emergency or urgent situations.
Healthcare providers, including doctors, nurses, and specialists.
Emergency response teams and hospital administrators.
Insurance companies verifying triage decisions for claims processing.
User Base Characteristics:

Size: Medium to large, based on the number of hospitals and clinics adopting the system.
Diversity: Includes patients across age groups and socioeconomic backgrounds, as well as providers with varying levels of tech proficiency.
Geographic Distribution: Designed for use in urban and rural healthcare systems, with support for remote locations.
Roles: Patients, medical staff, administrators, and technical support teams.
2. Functional Requirements
Core Features:

AI-Powered Triage: Real-time assessment of symptoms via a chatbot or mobile app, guiding patients to appropriate care levels.
Care Coordination Tools: Scheduling, communication, and resource allocation for healthcare teams.
Patient History Integration: Retrieval and analysis of patient medical records to inform triage and treatment.
Emergency Notifications: Alerts for critical cases sent to emergency teams and providers.
Analytics Dashboard: Real-time data for administrators to monitor patient flow and resource utilization.
Frequency of Authentication:

Patients: Authentication once per session, with optional biometric login for faster access.
Providers: Authentication at the start of each session and before accessing patient-sensitive data or making updates to records.
Sensitivity of Actions:

High sensitivity: Accessing patient history, creating or updating care plans, and handling emergency notifications.
Medium sensitivity: Scheduling appointments and managing non-urgent communications.
Low sensitivity: Browsing educational resources or general patient statistics.
3. Non-Functional Requirements
Performance:

Response time: < 2 seconds for AI triage decisions, < 5 seconds for record retrieval.
System uptime: 99.9% availability to ensure reliability during critical use.
Scalability:

Handle up to 20,000 concurrent users during peak times, with capacity for regional expansions.
Expandable storage for patient records and analytics data.
Reliability:

Robust failover systems to ensure continuity during outages.
Regular backups and real-time replication of patient data.
Security:

End-to-end encryption for all communications and data.
Role-based access control (RBAC) with audit logs for sensitive actions.
Usability:

User-friendly interfaces designed for non-technical patients and medical staff.
Multilingual support and compliance with WCAG 2.1 for accessibility.
4. Constraints
Technical Constraints:

Must integrate seamlessly with existing EHR systems and hospital management software.
Requires high availability of cloud services and minimal reliance on local hardware.
Compliance Requirements:

Fully compliant with HIPAA for patient data protection.
Adheres to GDPR for data privacy in international deployments.
Resource Constraints:

Initial development budget of $5 million with a delivery timeline of 18 months.
A development team of 20 engineers and 10 healthcare consultants.
Integration Needs:

Support for Single Sign-On (SSO) and compatibility with OAuth 2.0 for secure authentication.
Integration with public health systems for reporting and analytics.
This scenario outlines a robust and innovative system designed to improve patient outcomes through AI-driven triage and efficient care coordination, addressing the key needs of the healthcare domain.
