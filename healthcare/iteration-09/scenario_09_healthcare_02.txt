1. System Overview
System Purpose:
The system, CareSyncPro, aims to streamline the coordination of home healthcare services for patients with chronic conditions by enabling centralized scheduling, communication, and medical record sharing between care providers, patients, and families. The goal is to improve care quality, reduce hospital readmissions, and ensure timely delivery of services.

Domain/Context:
Home healthcare, focusing on patients with chronic illnesses such as diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and post-operative care needs. The system targets organizations providing in-home medical services and support.

Stakeholders:

Healthcare Providers: Home health nurses, therapists, social workers, and care coordinators.
Administrative Staff: Scheduling teams, compliance officers, and billing departments.
Patients and Caregivers: Individuals receiving in-home care and their family members.
Regulators: Monitoring compliance with healthcare standards and reimbursement processes.
User Base Characteristics:

Size: Approximately 100 home healthcare agencies in the initial rollout, with an estimated 2,000-3,000 users.
Diversity: A mix of professional care providers, administrative staff, patients, and family members.
Geographic Distribution: Users are dispersed across urban, suburban, and rural areas.
Roles: Care providers accessing patient records, schedulers managing appointments, patients reviewing care plans, and caregivers receiving updates.
Operational Environment:
The system is hosted on a secure cloud platform optimized for mobile and desktop use, ensuring accessibility in areas with limited connectivity. Offline access and sync capabilities are provided for care providers working in remote areas.

Usage Scenarios:

A nurse updates a patient's progress note during a home visit, syncing it to the central system upon regaining internet connectivity.
A caregiver reviews the patient's care schedule and confirms a nurse's visit for the next day.
A scheduler assigns new patient referrals to available providers based on location and workload.
Compliance officers review completed visit logs for insurance reimbursement purposes.
2. Functional Requirements
Core Features:

Centralized scheduling and calendar management for care providers.
Real-time patient health data recording, with offline data entry and sync capabilities.
Family caregiver portal for reviewing care schedules and progress updates.
Secure messaging between care teams, patients, and family members.
Automated notifications for upcoming visits and incomplete documentation.
Integration with medical device data, such as blood glucose monitors and heart rate trackers.
Authentication Conditions & Frequency:

Authentication is required at the start of each session, with sessions expiring after 45 minutes of inactivity.
Re-authentication is necessary for viewing sensitive data such as private medical records or generating compliance reports.
Offline users must authenticate when reconnecting to the internet and syncing data.
Sensitivity of Actions & Permission Levels:

High Sensitivity: Editing medical records, adjusting care plans, and generating compliance reports. Restricted to licensed care providers and administrators.
Medium Sensitivity: Scheduling visits and viewing patient history. Accessible to care coordinators and authorized family members.
Low Sensitivity: Viewing visit summaries and receiving notifications. Accessible to patients and caregivers.
3. Non-Functional Requirements
Performance:

Response times of <1.5 seconds for most operations under normal load.
Capable of processing up to 5,000 simultaneous users without noticeable degradation.
Scalability:

The system must scale to support up to 10,000 users and 500,000 patients over five years.
Dynamic resource allocation to handle peak usage, such as during weather-related care disruptions.
Reliability:

Uptime of 99.8%, with automatic failover mechanisms.
Data synchronization retry mechanisms for offline users, ensuring no data loss.
Security:

End-to-end encryption for all data transfers and storage.
Granular role-based access controls and frequent vulnerability assessments.
Usability:

Designed for mobile-first usability, with simple workflows for non-technical users.
Support for multiple languages, focusing on accessibility for diverse user groups.
Audit & Monitoring:

Detailed logging of user actions, with audit trails for medical and compliance data.
Alerts for unusual behavior, such as accessing records outside typical working hours.
4. Constraints
Technical Constraints:

The system must be compatible with major mobile operating systems (iOS and Android) and support limited internet connectivity.
Must adhere to HL7/FHIR standards for integration with external EHR systems.
Compliance Requirements:

HIPAA compliance for data security and privacy.
Adherence to CMS (Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services) regulations for reimbursement eligibility.
Resource Constraints:

Initial budget capped at $8 million for development and deployment.
Project team includes 20 developers, 8 QA testers, 4 UX designers, and 10 domain experts.
Implementation to be completed in 16 months, with staggered rollouts.
Integration Needs:

Seamless integration with at least two EHR systems and support for importing data from medical devices.
Ability to export data to billing software for insurance claims processing.
This scenario is distinct from others by focusing on the challenges of coordinating home healthcare services, with emphasis on offline access, caregiver engagement, and medical device integration. It aligns with the unique operational and technical demands of the home healthcare sector.
