1. System Overview
System Purpose:
The system, named MedTrack+, is designed to provide a centralized platform for managing patient care coordination and health data exchange across multiple healthcare providers. Its primary objective is to enhance collaboration, streamline workflows, and reduce redundant efforts by offering real-time updates, secure messaging, and shared patient records.

Domain/Context:
Healthcare - specifically targeting mid-sized hospitals, outpatient clinics, and telemedicine providers. The system operates in compliance with strict healthcare regulations, including HIPAA and local data protection laws.

Stakeholders:

Healthcare Providers: Physicians, nurses, therapists, and lab technicians.
Administrative Staff: Billing, scheduling, and case management teams.
Patients: Individuals accessing telehealth services or reviewing their health records.
IT Teams: Supporting infrastructure and ensuring operational uptime.
Regulators: Overseeing compliance with healthcare and data protection laws.
User Base Characteristics:

Size: Initially targeting 50-100 healthcare facilities, each with approximately 500-1,000 users.
Diversity: Includes various user roles such as doctors, nurses, administrators, and patients.
Geographic Distribution: Users are primarily located in urban and suburban areas, with remote access options for telemedicine staff.
Roles: System administrators, healthcare professionals, and patients, each with tailored access privileges.
Operational Environment:
Cloud-hosted on a secure, HIPAA-compliant platform. Accessible via desktop applications, web browsers, and mobile apps. The system supports hybrid environments to accommodate facilities with on-premise legacy systems.

Usage Scenarios:

A physician reviews a shared patient chart, updates diagnoses, and orders lab tests.
A nurse uses the system to document patient vitals and treatment notes in real-time.
A patient logs into the portal to schedule an appointment, view lab results, or join a telehealth consultation.
Billing staff generates and reviews claims for insurance reimbursement based on updated patient records.
2. Functional Requirements
Core Features:

Unified patient record management with real-time updates across facilities.
Appointment scheduling, reminders, and telehealth integration.
Secure messaging between providers and patients.
Automated workflows for referral management and follow-up tasks.
Role-based dashboards for different user groups.
Integration with electronic health record (EHR) systems and lab testing platforms.
Authentication Conditions & Frequency:

Users must authenticate at the start of each session (session timeout after 30 minutes of inactivity).
Re-authentication required for accessing sensitive data, such as mental health records or administrative reports.
High-sensitivity actions (e.g., updating permissions or generating compliance reports) trigger immediate re-authentication prompts.
Sensitivity of Actions & Permission Levels:

High Sensitivity: Editing patient data, accessing audit logs, modifying user roles. Restricted to administrators and senior medical staff.
Medium Sensitivity: Approving lab results, viewing referral data. Restricted to licensed medical professionals.
Low Sensitivity: Viewing non-sensitive patient records, scheduling appointments. Accessible to patients and clerical staff.
3. Non-Functional Requirements
Performance:

Average response time < 1 second for most interactions.
Ability to handle up to 10,000 concurrent users with no more than 2% latency increase.
Scalability:

Must support growth to 500 facilities and 1 million users within three years.
Seamless horizontal scaling of infrastructure during peak usage (e.g., telehealth sessions).
Reliability:

System uptime of 99.9%.
Automatic failover mechanisms and disaster recovery with data replication across three geographic zones.
Security:

End-to-end encryption for data in transit and at rest.
Advanced access control policies with multi-tiered permission models.
Regular vulnerability assessments and penetration testing.
Usability:

Intuitive interfaces for both medical and non-technical users.
Support for accessibility standards such as WCAG 2.1 for visually impaired users.
Contextual tooltips and in-app training modules.
Audit & Monitoring:

Comprehensive logging of all user actions and system events.
Reports for authentication events, data access, and anomalies, reviewed quarterly.
Real-time alerts for unauthorized access attempts or unusual activity patterns.
4. Constraints
Technical Constraints:

Must run on existing cloud infrastructure compliant with healthcare standards (e.g., AWS Healthcare or Azure for Health).
Compatibility with HL7 and FHIR standards for EHR data exchange.
Compliance Requirements:

Adherence to HIPAA, GDPR (for international users), and state-specific healthcare laws.
Periodic audits to ensure continued compliance with data protection regulations.
Resource Constraints:

Initial development budget capped at $10 million.
Team includes 25 developers, 10 QA testers, 5 UX designers, and 15 healthcare consultants.
Go-live within 18 months, with phased releases every 6 months.
Integration Needs:

Must integrate seamlessly with at least three major EHR systems used by partner facilities.
Compatibility with existing telehealth and billing software solutions.
