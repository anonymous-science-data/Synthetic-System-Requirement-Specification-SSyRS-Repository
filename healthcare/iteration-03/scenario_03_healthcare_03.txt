Healthcare Software System Scenario
1. System Overview
System Purpose:
Develop an AI-Driven Medical Imaging Analysis Platform (AMIP) to assist radiologists and physicians in analyzing diagnostic imaging (e.g., X-rays, CT scans, MRIs). The system's objectives include reducing diagnostic errors, speeding up analysis time, and improving accessibility to imaging services in underserved areas.

Domain/Context:
Operates within the healthcare domain, specifically in medical imaging and diagnostics. It leverages artificial intelligence to enhance clinical decision-making.

Stakeholders:

Primary: Radiologists, diagnostic technicians, general practitioners, patients.
Secondary: Hospital administrators, AI researchers, healthcare regulators, and insurance providers.
User Base Characteristics:

Size: Approximately 20,000 users in the initial rollout, with expansion potential to 100,000 globally.
Diversity: Users include highly trained specialists, general healthcare providers, and administrative staff with varying technical skills.
Geographic Distribution: Initial focus on urban hospitals, with phased deployment to rural clinics and international markets.
Roles: Radiologists, imaging technicians, IT administrators, and patient service representatives.
2. Functional Requirements
Core Features:

Image Analysis and Annotation: AI algorithms to detect anomalies such as tumors or fractures in medical images.
Case Prioritization: Automatic triaging of urgent cases based on severity detected in scans.
Integration with EHRs: Seamless integration with electronic health records to link diagnostic findings with patient history.
Reporting Tools: Auto-generated reports with AI findings, editable by radiologists.
Feedback Loop for AI Training: Mechanism for radiologists to validate and correct AI findings, improving accuracy over time.
Frequency of Authentication:

Radiologists and Technicians: Per session, with re-authentication required for editing reports or overriding AI findings.
Administrators: Per session with additional authentication for system configuration changes.
Sensitivity of Actions:

High sensitivity: Overriding AI findings, modifying patient records, configuring AI algorithms.
Medium sensitivity: Viewing AI-generated reports and patient data.
Low sensitivity: Accessing non-patient-specific system usage analytics.
3. Non-Functional Requirements
Performance:

AI image analysis results delivered within 2 minutes for 95% of cases.
System response time under 1 second for all user interactions.
Scalability:

Capable of processing 10,000 images per hour at peak usage with no degradation in performance.
Reliability:

99.9% uptime with built-in redundancy for critical operations.
Automated recovery systems with an RTO (Recovery Time Objective) of 15 minutes.
Security:

Compliance with HIPAA and international standards for medical data protection.
End-to-end encryption for all data transmissions.
Advanced role-based access control with audit logs for all system activities.
Usability:

Simplified UI with customizable dashboards for different user roles.
Accessibility features for visually impaired users, including screen reader compatibility.
4. Constraints
Technical Constraints:

Must operate on high-performance cloud infrastructure, optimized for AI workloads.
Dependency on DICOM (Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine) standards for image compatibility.
Compliance Requirements:

Full adherence to HIPAA, GDPR, and local medical data handling regulations.
Subject to periodic external audits and certifications for AI accuracy and fairness.
Resource Constraints:

Development budget capped at $15 million.
Delivery timeline of 30 months with a team of 60 professionals, including AI specialists, software developers, and domain experts.
Integration Needs:

Must integrate with existing hospital PACS (Picture Archiving and Communication System) and EHR platforms.
Support for third-party AI models for future scalability.
This scenario provides a comprehensive vision for a medical imaging platform that addresses critical challenges in diagnostics while adhering to healthcare industry constraints and compliance requirements.
