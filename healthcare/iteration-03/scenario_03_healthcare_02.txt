Healthcare Software System Scenario
1. System Overview
System Purpose:
Design and implement a Telehealth Monitoring and Management System (TMMS) to enable remote monitoring of patients with chronic conditions and support virtual consultations. The system's primary objectives include reducing hospital readmissions, improving treatment adherence, and providing timely interventions through data-driven alerts.

Domain/Context:
Operates in the healthcare domain, focusing on telemedicine and remote patient management for chronic diseases such as diabetes, hypertension, and respiratory conditions.

Stakeholders:

Primary: Physicians, nurses, chronic disease specialists, patients, and caregivers.
Secondary: Telehealth service providers, insurance companies, and healthcare regulatory bodies.
User Base Characteristics:

Size: 100,000 users in the initial deployment, with scalability to 500,000.
Diversity: Includes rural and urban populations, varying levels of digital literacy, and multilingual needs.
Geographic Distribution: Targeted at both urban centers and underserved rural areas.
Roles: Patients, healthcare providers, IT support teams, and system administrators.
2. Functional Requirements
Core Features:

Real-Time Health Data Monitoring: Integration with wearable health devices to track vitals (e.g., heart rate, blood glucose, oxygen levels).
Virtual Consultations: Video conferencing for doctor-patient interactions.
Health Alerts: Automated alerts for abnormal readings, sent to both patients and care teams.
Medication Reminders: Personalized notifications to ensure treatment adherence.
Patient Health Records: Centralized repository for medical history, accessible by authorized users.
Frequency of Authentication:

Patients: Per session with optional biometric login for ease of access.
Providers: Per session with mandatory re-authentication for high-sensitivity actions like prescribing medications or accessing critical patient records.
Sensitivity of Actions:

High sensitivity: Viewing patient health data, issuing prescriptions, setting emergency alerts.
Medium sensitivity: Editing care plans, adding notes to patient records.
Low sensitivity: Viewing educational materials or general announcements.
3. Non-Functional Requirements
Performance:

System should support 200 concurrent video sessions with latency under 1 second.
Data streaming for wearable devices must have a delay of less than 5 seconds.
Scalability:

Able to handle a 500% increase in users over 3 years without degradation in performance.
Reliability:

99.95% system uptime with automatic failover and real-time error monitoring.
Recovery time objective (RTO) of 30 minutes in case of a major failure.
Security:

End-to-end encryption for all video consultations and health data transmissions.
Compliance with HIPAA and local telemedicine regulations.
Role-based access control with detailed audit logs.
Usability:

User-friendly mobile app with support for voice commands and text-to-speech for accessibility.
Multilingual support for English, Spanish, and other major regional languages.
4. Constraints
Technical Constraints:

Must operate on a hybrid cloud infrastructure with AWS as the primary cloud provider.
Use of open APIs for wearable device integrations.
Compliance Requirements:

Full compliance with HIPAA, GDPR, and regional telehealth-specific regulations.
Regular third-party security audits every 6 months.
Resource Constraints:

Development budget of $8 million, with a timeline of 24 months.
Dedicated team of 40 professionals, including developers, designers, and healthcare consultants.
Integration Needs:

Seamless integration with existing EHR systems and wearable health devices (e.g., Fitbit, Apple Watch).
Support for integration with pharmacy systems to enable e-prescriptions.
This scenario is tailored to address modern challenges in remote healthcare delivery, emphasizing accessibility, scalability, and compliance with healthcare regulations.
