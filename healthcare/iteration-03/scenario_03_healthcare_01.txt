Healthcare Software System Scenario
1. System Overview
System Purpose:
Develop a centralized Patient-Centric Care Coordination Platform (PCCP) to streamline communication between healthcare providers, patients, and caregivers. The system's main objectives include improving patient outcomes through enhanced care planning, reducing administrative overhead, and ensuring compliance with healthcare regulations.

Domain/Context:
The system operates within the healthcare domain, particularly in managing patient care for chronic diseases, post-surgical recovery, and elderly care.

Stakeholders:

Primary: Physicians, nurses, care coordinators, patients, caregivers.
Secondary: Hospital administrators, health insurance companies, and regulatory bodies.
User Base Characteristics:

Size: Estimated 50,000 users across multiple regions within a country.
Diversity: Users range from tech-savvy younger caregivers to elderly patients with minimal technological experience.
Geographic Distribution: National rollout with potential international expansion.
Roles: Includes patients, healthcare providers, administrative staff, and IT support teams.
2. Functional Requirements
Core Features:

Patient Profiles: Comprehensive profiles with medical history, medications, and care plans.
Real-Time Communication: Secure messaging and video calls between stakeholders.
Care Coordination: Tools for creating, tracking, and updating care plans collaboratively.
Appointment Scheduling: Integrated scheduling with reminders for patients and providers.
Analytics Dashboard: Insights into patient health metrics and care plan adherence.
Frequency of Authentication:

Patients: Once per session unless accessing sensitive medical records.
Providers: Per session with re-authentication for high-risk actions such as prescribing medications.
Sensitivity of Actions:

High sensitivity: Modifying patient medical records, prescribing medications, accessing diagnostic reports.
Medium sensitivity: Updating care plans, scheduling appointments.
Low sensitivity: Viewing general health education materials.
3. Non-Functional Requirements
Performance:

Response times under 2 seconds for 90% of user interactions.
System throughput of 100 transactions per second during peak times.
Scalability:

Handle up to 100,000 users with minimal performance degradation.
Easily extendable to support international operations with language and compliance customizations.
Reliability:

99.9% uptime with failover mechanisms and disaster recovery in under 1 hour.
Automated data backup every 12 hours.
Security:

Full compliance with HIPAA for data protection.
Multi-factor authentication (MFA) for providers and optional MFA for patients.
End-to-end encryption for all communication channels.
Usability:

Intuitive user interface with accessibility features for visually impaired and elderly users.
Mobile application optimized for various screen sizes and platforms.
4. Constraints
Technical Constraints:

Cloud-hosted architecture with mandatory use of FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) standards for interoperability.
Limited on-premises deployment support due to budget constraints.
Compliance Requirements:

Adherence to HIPAA in the U.S. and GDPR for potential European expansion.
Regular security audits and risk assessments as per regulatory guidelines.
Resource Constraints:

Development budget capped at $5 million.
Project completion within 18 months with a core team of 25 developers, designers, and analysts.
Integration Needs:

Must integrate with existing hospital electronic health record (EHR) systems and health insurance platforms.
Compatibility with third-party health devices (e.g., wearable trackers) via APIs.
This scenario outlines a robust plan for implementing a healthcare software system designed to address the industry's challenges and regulatory demands while improving patient and provider experiences.
