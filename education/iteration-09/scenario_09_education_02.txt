4. Constraints
Technical Constraints:

Integration with legacy systems used by some institutions for student information management.
Cloud hosting limited to providers compliant with local data residency regulations.
Compliance Requirements:

Adherence to FERPA and state-specific vocational training regulations.
Certification formats must align with industry accreditation standards.
Resource Constraints:

Initial budget of $1.5 million, with a team of 10 developers, 3 QA engineers, and 2 project managers.
Development timeline of 12 months, with a phased rollout starting in the 10th month.
Integration Needs:
