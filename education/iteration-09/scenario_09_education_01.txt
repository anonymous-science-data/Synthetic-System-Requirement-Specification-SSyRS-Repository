1. System Overview
System Purpose:
The system, EducatorLink, aims to streamline communication and administrative workflows between educators, students, and parents within a school district. The primary goal is to improve engagement, automate repetitive administrative tasks, and provide actionable insights into student performance through data visualization and analysis.

Domain/Context:
K-12 education, encompassing both public and private institutions across a mid-sized U.S. school district.

Stakeholders:

Primary Users: Teachers, students, and school administrators.
Secondary Users: Parents and guardians.
Beneficiaries: School boards and district-level administrators seeking aggregated insights into performance trends.
User Base Characteristics:

Size: Approximately 30,000 users (20,000 students, 8,000 parents/guardians, 2,000 educators and administrators).
Diversity: Users span different socio-economic backgrounds, levels of technical proficiency, and linguistic preferences, requiring multi-language support.
Geographic Distribution: Users are located across multiple schools within a 100-mile radius.
Operational Environment:
The system is hosted on a hybrid cloud infrastructure to ensure accessibility and reliability. Users interact with the system via web-based dashboards and mobile apps compatible with iOS and Android devices.

Usage Scenarios:

Educators: Manage lesson plans, grade assignments, and provide feedback through an intuitive interface.
Students: Submit assignments, access class materials, and track their grades and attendance.
Parents: View their child's performance, communicate with teachers, and receive alerts about upcoming events or low performance.
Administrators: Generate reports on student performance trends, manage attendance records, and oversee compliance with district policies.
2. Functional Requirements
Core Features:

Communication Portal: Secure messaging between educators, students, and parents.
Gradebook: Teachers can input grades and students/parents can view real-time performance metrics.
Assignment Submission: Students upload assignments directly, and educators can annotate and provide feedback within the system.
Attendance Tracking: Automated logging and visualization of attendance data.
Analytics Dashboard: District-wide performance insights for administrators.
Event Alerts: Notifications for events like parent-teacher conferences or urgent updates.
Authentication Conditions & Frequency:

Session-Based Authentication: Users authenticate once per session, with sessions expiring after 12 hours of inactivity.
Sensitive Actions: Re-authentication is required for grade modifications, access to financial aid records, and administrative data exports.
Password Reset: A secondary authentication step (e.g., email-based OTP) is needed to reset passwords.
Sensitivity of Actions & Permission Levels:

Highly Sensitive: Gradebook modifications, student report generation (restricted to authorized educators and administrators).
Moderately Sensitive: Assignment uploads, attendance management.
Low Sensitivity: Viewing class materials and non-confidential notifications.
3. Non-Functional Requirements
Performance:

Response times under 2 seconds for 90% of operations, even during peak usage (e.g., grading deadlines).
Scalability:

Capable of supporting a 25% annual increase in users without performance degradation.
Reliability:

99.9% uptime, with automated backups every 6 hours and recovery time of under 30 minutes in case of system failure.
Security:

Data encryption in transit (TLS 1.3) and at rest (AES-256).
Role-based access control (RBAC) for permissions.
Usability:

Interfaces designed to meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards for accessibility.
Multi-language support (English, Spanish, Mandarin).
Audit & Monitoring:

Comprehensive logging of all access and changes to sensitive data.
Weekly reports on system usage patterns and any unauthorized access attempts.
4. Constraints
Technical Constraints:

Limited on-premise server resources at individual schools, necessitating reliance on cloud infrastructure for high-demand functionalities.
Integration with existing student information systems (SIS) for seamless data exchange.
Compliance Requirements:

Adherence to FERPA for student data privacy.
State-mandated reporting formats for attendance and performance data.
Resource Constraints:

Initial budget allocation of $2 million, including software development, testing, and deployment.
Dedicated team of 12 developers, 4 QA engineers, and 3 project managers.
Deployment timeline of 18 months.
Integration Needs:

Integration with popular third-party tools like Google Classroom and Microsoft Teams for content synchronization.
Single sign-on (SSO) integration with district-level authentication systems.
