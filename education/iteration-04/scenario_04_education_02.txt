1. System Overview
System Purpose:
The system is a comprehensive Student Information System (SIS) designed to streamline administrative processes for higher education institutions. Its primary goal is to manage student enrollment, course registration, academic records, and provide real-time analytics to improve operational efficiency and decision-making.

Domain/Context:
The education sector, focusing on universities and colleges offering both in-person and online courses. The system addresses the need for centralized management of student data across diverse academic programs.

Stakeholders:

Students: Primary users for enrollment, course management, and accessing academic records.
Faculty: Users managing course schedules, grades, and student engagement.
Administrators: Responsible for data oversight, compliance, and resource allocation.
IT Teams: Ensure technical stability and system integration.
User Base Characteristics:

User base of approximately 50,000 students, faculty, and administrators distributed across multiple campuses.
Users range from tech-savvy younger students to older faculty members less familiar with digital platforms.
Global access requirements for international students and online programs.
2. Functional Requirements
Core Features:

Student Portal: Centralized access for enrollment, fee payments, grades, and transcripts.
Faculty Portal: Tools for managing course materials, grades, and class schedules.
Administrative Dashboard: Analytics for enrollment trends, retention rates, and compliance reporting.
Notification System: Alerts for deadlines, registration openings, and policy changes.
Document Management: Secure uploading and sharing of academic documents (e.g., transcripts, certifications).
Mobile Access: Full functionality available through mobile applications.
Frequency of Authentication:

Per Session: All users authenticate at the start of each session via Single Sign-On (SSO).
Sensitive Actions: Submitting grades, approving registration changes, and accessing financial records require multi-factor authentication (MFA).
Sensitivity of Actions:

High Sensitivity: Access to financial aid information, grade submissions, and personal student data.
Moderate Sensitivity: Updating course schedules and administrative reporting.
Low Sensitivity: Viewing public course catalogs and announcements.
3. Non-Functional Requirements
Performance:

Dashboards must load within 3 seconds for 95% of users.
System should support simultaneous access by up to 10,000 concurrent users during peak registration periods.
Scalability:

Designed to accommodate growth to 100,000 users within five years, including increased data storage needs.
Must handle seasonal spikes in usage (e.g., registration and exam periods).
Reliability:

System uptime of 99.9% with automated failover for critical services.
Daily automated backups with recovery time objectives (RTO) under 1 hour.
Security:

Compliance with GDPR and regional data protection laws for international users.
Role-based access control (RBAC) to limit data visibility based on user roles.
End-to-end encryption for all sensitive data transmissions.
Usability:

User-friendly interface with tailored views for students, faculty, and administrators.
Built-in tutorials and live chat support for resolving technical issues.
4. Constraints
Technical Constraints:

Must integrate with existing university systems, including legacy databases and Learning Management Systems (LMS).
Limited by current network infrastructure at older campuses, requiring bandwidth-efficient solutions.
Compliance Requirements:

Adherence to GDPR for international students' data.
Compliance with U.S. FERPA regulations for student record privacy.
Resource Constraints:

Initial budget of $1,000,000 with an annual maintenance allocation of $250,000.
Development timeline capped at 12 months to align with the academic calendar.
Integration Needs:

Seamless integration with third-party tools, including LMS platforms like Blackboard and Canvas.
SSO integration with university identity management systems.
This scenario outlines a realistic and detailed approach to addressing the challenges and goals specific to higher education institutions, considering domain-specific constraints and user needs.
