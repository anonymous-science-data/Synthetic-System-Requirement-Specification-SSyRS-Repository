1. System Overview
System Purpose:
The system is an adaptive learning platform designed for middle and high school students, with a focus on personalized education. The primary objective is to tailor educational content to individual learning styles and progress, enabling students to achieve mastery in core subjects such as math, science, and language arts.

Domain/Context:
The education sector, specifically targeting public and private schools in middle- and low-income areas. The platform supports both in-class and remote learning environments, addressing the gap in access to quality, customized education tools.

Stakeholders:

Students: Primary users, benefiting from personalized lesson plans and feedback.
Teachers: Responsible for assigning content, monitoring progress, and adjusting learning pathways.
School Administrators: Use the platform for analytics on student performance and resource allocation.
Parents/Guardians: Have limited access to view student progress and communicate with teachers.
Content Providers: Vendors or contributors of educational materials integrated into the system.
User Base Characteristics:

Targeting approximately 15,000 users initially, including students, teachers, and administrators across 50 schools.
Includes students with varying levels of technical proficiency and accessibility needs.
Geographic distribution includes rural areas with inconsistent internet access and urban schools with better infrastructure.
2. Functional Requirements
Core Features:

Personalized Learning Pathways: Adaptive algorithms to customize lesson sequences based on student performance and learning styles.
Teacher Dashboard: Tools for monitoring student progress, assigning tasks, and generating reports.
Student Portal: Gamified interface to encourage engagement with learning modules.
Parent Access: Simple views of student progress, performance trends, and key feedback.
Offline Mode: Ability to download lessons and sync progress once reconnected to the internet.
Assessment Tools: Formative and summative assessments with auto-grading capabilities.
Frequency of Authentication:

Per Session: All users authenticate at the start of each session.
Sensitive Actions: Actions like modifying grades, altering curriculum, and accessing detailed analytics require multi-factor authentication (MFA).
Sensitivity of Actions:

High Sensitivity: Viewing or modifying student performance records and administrative analytics.
Moderate Sensitivity: Assigning assessments and managing class rosters.
Low Sensitivity: Viewing publicly available content and curriculum resources.
3. Non-Functional Requirements
Performance:

Lesson loading times should not exceed 2.5 seconds for 90% of users, even in rural locations with slower internet speeds.
Capable of handling 3,000 concurrent users during peak hours.
Scalability:

Designed to expand to 50,000 users within five years, with provisions for adding new schools and districts without major system overhauls.
Reliability:

Uptime of 99.8% with automatic failover for critical services.
Daily backups with recovery time objectives (RTO) under 2 hours.
Security:

End-to-end encryption for data transfers and AES-256 encryption for stored data.
Role-based access control (RBAC) for all users, ensuring appropriate levels of data visibility.
Compliance with FERPA for student data privacy.
Usability:

Accessible interface with WCAG 2.1 AA compliance, including support for screen readers and keyboard navigation.
Interactive tutorials and 24/7 support for both teachers and administrators.
4. Constraints
Technical Constraints:

Must operate on low-cost devices such as tablets and Chromebooks, frequently used in low-income schools.
Offline functionality is mandatory for areas with unreliable internet.
Compliance Requirements:

Adherence to FERPA for student data privacy.
Compliance with COPPA for students under 13 years old.
Resource Constraints:

Development budget of $750,000 and an annual maintenance budget of $150,000.
Project timeline of 18 months to deliver a minimum viable product (MVP).
Integration Needs:

Integration with existing Learning Management Systems (e.g., Google Classroom, Microsoft Teams).
Compatibility with Single Sign-On (SSO) solutions for streamlined authentication.
This scenario is tailored to address the challenges and opportunities in education systems for underserved communities, ensuring realistic alignment with the sector's goals and constraints.
