1. System Overview
System Purpose:
The system aims to deliver a comprehensive Learning Management System (LMS) tailored for K-12 educational institutions. Its primary objective is to enhance student engagement, streamline teacher workflows, and provide actionable insights to administrators for data-driven decision-making.

Domain/Context:
The education sector, focusing on K-12 schools in urban, suburban, and rural settings. The system will support both in-classroom and hybrid learning models, ensuring accessibility for students with varying levels of digital literacy and resources.

Stakeholders:

Students: Primary users, ranging from early elementary to high school.
Teachers: Users responsible for managing courses, grading, and student communication.
Administrators: Responsible for oversight, compliance, and resource allocation.
Parents/Guardians: Stakeholders who monitor student progress and engagement.
IT Support Teams: Ensuring the system's smooth technical operation.
User Base Characteristics:

Approximately 10,000 active users spread across multiple districts.
Diverse user roles, including students with accessibility needs and educators with varying technical skills.
Geographically distributed across urban and remote regions, requiring adaptable solutions for inconsistent internet connectivity.
2. Functional Requirements
Core Features:

Student Portal: A dashboard to access assignments, grades, and resources.
Teacher Portal: Tools for creating lesson plans, scheduling classes, assigning homework, and tracking progress.
Parent Access: Limited access to monitor student performance and communicate with teachers.
Interactive Assessments: Tools for quizzes, exams, and automatic grading.
Analytics Dashboard: Reports on attendance, performance trends, and resource usage for administrators.
Communication Tools: Secure messaging and notification systems for students, teachers, and parents.
Accessibility Features: Screen readers, high-contrast modes, and translation support.
Frequency of Authentication:

Per Session: Students, teachers, and parents authenticate at the start of each session.
Sensitive Actions: Grading changes, accessing personal student data, and administrative reporting require multi-factor authentication (MFA).
Sensitivity of Actions:

High Sensitivity: Accessing student records, administrative reports, and financial data.
Moderate Sensitivity: Submitting grades and communicating with students.
Low Sensitivity: Viewing public course materials or announcements.
3. Non-Functional Requirements
Performance:

The system must load dashboard views within 2 seconds for 95% of users.
Concurrent support for up to 1,500 active users without performance degradation.
Scalability:

Must support growth to 25,000 users within three years.
Capable of handling 10% monthly increases in data (e.g., assignments, reports).
Reliability:

System uptime of 99.95% with failover mechanisms for critical operations.
Automatic recovery for interrupted sessions without data loss.
Security:

Data encryption in transit and at rest (AES-256).
Role-based access control (RBAC) with regular audit logs.
Compliance with FERPA and COPPA for student data protection.
Usability:

Intuitive UI for young learners (ages 6+) and customizable views for older students and teachers.
Tutorials and help sections to assist less tech-savvy users.
4. Constraints
Technical Constraints:

Must operate on existing district-provided devices, which include older Chromebooks and low-end tablets.
Limited to integration with the current district network infrastructure, which has bandwidth constraints in rural schools.
Compliance Requirements:

Adherence to FERPA for student record privacy.
COPPA compliance for users under 13 years old.
Accessibility standards per WCAG 2.1 AA guidelines.
Resource Constraints:

Initial development budget of $500,000 with an annual maintenance cap of $100,000.
Limited IT staffing at smaller schools requires automated updates and minimal manual intervention.
Integration Needs:

Must integrate seamlessly with Google Workspace for Education (e.g., Google Classroom, Google Drive).
Single Sign-On (SSO) compatibility with existing Active Directory setups.
This scenario highlights realistic challenges and goals within the education sector, ensuring alignment with both user needs and industry-specific constraints.
