Scenario: Virtual STEM Learning Platform for Secondary Schools
1. System Overview
System Purpose:
The system is a virtual learning platform designed to support STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) education for secondary school students. Its goal is to provide hands-on, interactive, and collaborative learning experiences, incorporating simulations, virtual labs, and project-based activities to enhance STEM skills and prepare students for higher education and careers.

Domain/Context:
The system operates in the K-12 education sector, specifically focusing on secondary education (grades 6-12). It supports hybrid and remote learning, enabling schools to meet the increasing demand for engaging STEM curricula in diverse settings.

Stakeholders:

Primary Stakeholders: Teachers, students, and school administrators.
Secondary Stakeholders: Curriculum designers, district education boards, and industry partners contributing STEM resources.
User Base Characteristics:

User base includes 50,000 students and 8,000 teachers across a mix of urban, suburban, and rural schools.
The system caters to diverse technical proficiency levels, from tech-savvy teachers to those requiring training.
Geographic distribution is national, with a focus on areas where STEM programs are underdeveloped.
Operational Environment:

Cloud-hosted platform accessible via desktop browsers, mobile devices, and dedicated school-provided tablets.
Schools with limited internet connectivity can use offline modules for core features, syncing data when a connection is available.
Usage Scenarios:

Students participate in virtual lab experiments and collaborate on group projects.
Teachers design assignments, monitor real-time student progress, and evaluate submissions.
Administrators access reports on participation and performance to guide resource allocation.
Curriculum designers integrate new STEM content, such as simulations and industry-aligned challenges.
2. Functional Requirements
Core Features:

Virtual Labs and Simulations: Provides physics, chemistry, and biology experiments, along with coding and robotics challenges.
Collaboration Tools: Includes video conferencing, discussion boards, and shared project workspaces for group activities.
Progress Tracking: Dashboards for teachers and students displaying key performance indicators (KPIs) and milestones.
Content Library: Offers a repository of STEM lessons, interactive tutorials, and quizzes aligned with national standards.
Gamification Elements: Rewards system for completing challenges and participating in STEM competitions.
Authentication Conditions & Frequency:

All users authenticate once per session.
Re-authentication is required after 30 minutes of inactivity or when accessing sensitive teacher or administrator tools, such as grade management or modifying curricula.
Sensitivity of Actions & Permission Levels:

High Sensitivity (Admins): Managing user accounts, modifying school-wide reports, and integrating external content.
Medium Sensitivity (Teachers): Creating/editing assignments, viewing student performance data, and initiating group collaborations.
Low Sensitivity (Students): Viewing assignments, accessing virtual labs, and submitting project work.
3. Non-Functional Requirements
Performance:

System must deliver response times under 3 seconds for 90% of actions, even during peak usage.
Virtual lab simulations must run without lag on devices with basic hardware specifications.
Scalability:

Capable of supporting up to 100,000 concurrent users during national STEM competition events.
Cloud architecture designed for horizontal scaling to accommodate future expansions.
Reliability:

Ensures 99.5% uptime with scheduled maintenance during off-peak hours.
Automatic failover mechanisms to handle unexpected server outages.
Security:

Role-based access control with encryption of all data in transit and at rest.
Compliance with child data protection laws and proactive vulnerability assessments.
Usability:

Designed for ease of use, with tutorials and help features accessible directly within the platform.
Accessible to users with disabilities, adhering to WCAG 2.1 standards.
Audit & Monitoring:

Logs all user actions, such as data access and modifications, for a 12-month retention period.
Real-time alerts for suspicious activities, such as unauthorized access attempts.
4. Constraints
Technical Constraints:

System must operate effectively on older devices commonly found in rural schools.
Offline modules limited to core features, such as basic experiments and quizzes.
Compliance Requirements:

Adheres to the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) and relevant state-specific privacy regulations.
Ensures alignment with STEM education standards issued by national and regional education boards.
Resource Constraints:

Development budget capped at $2.5 million over 18 months.
Limited availability of STEM experts for content creation, requiring phased rollout of the content library.
Integration Needs:

Integrates with existing Student Information Systems (SIS) for automatic synchronization of user accounts and performance data.
Compatible with widely used third-party tools, such as Zoom for video conferencing and Google Workspace for file sharing.
This scenario provides a realistic and coherent depiction of a Virtual STEM Learning Platform, aligning well with educational goals, technical constraints, and industry standards.
