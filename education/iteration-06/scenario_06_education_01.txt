Scenario: Online Learning Management System for K-12 Education
1. System Overview
System Purpose:
The system is designed to provide a comprehensive online platform for K-12 schools, enabling educators to create, deliver, and manage digital content and assessments while fostering collaboration among students, teachers, and parents. The goal is to enhance learning outcomes through personalized instruction and seamless communication.

Domain/Context:
K-12 education, focused on supporting digital learning in public and private schools. The system addresses the growing need for hybrid and fully online education solutions.

Stakeholders:

Primary Stakeholders: Teachers, students, school administrators, parents.
Secondary Stakeholders: IT support staff, school district policymakers, and external content providers.
User Base Characteristics:

Approximately 100,000 active users, including 70,000 students, 20,000 teachers, and 10,000 administrators and parents.
Geographic distribution includes urban and rural schools across a single country.
Diverse roles, with varying levels of technical proficiency, from digitally native students to teachers with minimal tech experience.
Operational Environment:

Cloud-hosted system accessible via web browsers and mobile apps (Android and iOS).
Supports both in-classroom use (on school devices) and remote learning (on personal devices).
High availability to accommodate asynchronous learning schedules.
Usage Scenarios:

Teachers create and assign interactive lessons and quizzes.
Students complete assignments, participate in forums, and view personalized progress reports.
Parents monitor their child's performance and communicate with teachers.
Administrators generate reports on school-wide performance metrics and ensure compliance with educational standards.
2. Functional Requirements
Core Features:

Content Management: Teachers can upload or create multimedia lessons, quizzes, and assignments.
Student Progress Tracking: Detailed dashboards displaying academic progress, attendance, and engagement metrics.
Communication Tools: Secure messaging and discussion forums for teacher-student and teacher-parent interactions.
Gradebook Integration: Automated grading and seamless export to district-wide gradebook systems.
Analytics and Reporting: Advanced analytics for administrators, including performance trends and demographic breakdowns.
Authentication Conditions & Frequency:

Users authenticate at the start of each session.
Sensitive actions, such as updating student records or accessing private communication threads, require re-authentication if the session has been idle for 15 minutes.
Administrators require multi-session validation for accessing audit logs or modifying system configurations.
Sensitivity of Actions & Permission Levels:

High Sensitivity (Admin-only): Modifying system settings, exporting full school data, and managing user roles.
Medium Sensitivity (Teachers): Creating assignments, editing grades, and initiating parent-teacher communication.
Low Sensitivity (Students/Parents): Viewing assignments, progress reports, and non-sensitive communications.
3. Non-Functional Requirements
Performance:

Response time must not exceed 2 seconds for 95% of user actions under normal load.
The system must support up to 10,000 concurrent users during peak usage.
Scalability:

Ability to scale horizontally to support future growth, potentially doubling the user base within five years.
Efficiently handle spikes in usage during school-wide events like report card release days.
Reliability:

99.9% uptime SLA, with automatic failover to backup servers in case of primary server failure.
Data recovery within 30 minutes of a critical incident.
Security:

Role-based access control to restrict unauthorized actions.
Encryption for all data in transit and at rest.
Regular security audits to identify vulnerabilities.
Usability:

Intuitive interface with accessibility features such as screen reader compatibility and high-contrast modes.
Multilingual support for the top three spoken languages in the region.
Audit & Monitoring:

Comprehensive logs for all user actions, with filters for role-specific activities.
Alerts for unauthorized access attempts or data anomalies.
4. Constraints
Technical Constraints:

Must be compatible with existing district infrastructure, including Single Sign-On (SSO) systems.
Limited internet bandwidth in rural schools, requiring offline capabilities for key functionalities.
Compliance Requirements:

Must comply with the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA).
Adherence to regional child data protection laws and educational standards.
Resource Constraints:

Initial budget of $1.5 million for development and deployment over 12 months.
Limited in-house technical expertise at smaller schools, necessitating robust customer support.
Integration Needs:

Seamless integration with third-party learning tools like Google Classroom and Microsoft Teams.
API compatibility with district-level Student Information Systems (SIS) for synchronized data sharing.
This scenario captures realistic requirements, goals, and constraints for a K-12 Learning Management System while aligning with industry standards.
