Scenario: Adaptive Learning Platform for Language Education
1. System Overview
System Purpose:
The platform provides personalized, adaptive learning experiences for K-12 students to develop and enhance language skills. The system uses AI-driven assessments to tailor content, ensuring students progress at their own pace while achieving language proficiency goals.

Domain/Context:
The system operates in the Education sector, focusing on language acquisition for K-12 students. It supports hybrid, remote, and in-classroom learning, addressing the challenges of diverse learning speeds and proficiency levels.

Stakeholders:

Primary Stakeholders: Students, language teachers, school administrators.
Secondary Stakeholders: Curriculum developers, parents, and district-level education authorities.
User Base Characteristics:

Serves 30,000 students, 5,000 teachers, and 2,000 administrators across urban and rural schools.
Diverse technical skill levels among users, with students using mobile devices and teachers primarily working from desktops.
Geographically dispersed, with a mix of schools in multilingual regions.
Operational Environment:

Cloud-hosted system accessible through web browsers and mobile apps.
Offline support for exercises and quizzes, syncing progress when connected.
Designed for use during school hours and for homework assignments at home.
Usage Scenarios:

Students complete personalized lessons, quizzes, and speaking exercises tailored to their proficiency level.
Teachers monitor student progress, assign supplementary material, and provide feedback.
Administrators analyze performance reports to identify trends and guide teacher training programs.
Parents track their child's progress and communicate with teachers.
2. Functional Requirements
Core Features:

Adaptive Learning Engine: Adjusts the difficulty and content of lessons based on real-time student performance.
Assessment Tools: Automated evaluations of reading, writing, and speaking skills, including AI-powered pronunciation feedback.
Content Repository: Library of language resources, including grammar lessons, vocabulary lists, and interactive dialogues.
Teacher Dashboard: Tools to assign tasks, track progress, and generate class-level and individual performance reports.
Gamification Elements: Leaderboards and badges to motivate students and encourage active participation.
Authentication Conditions & Frequency:

Users authenticate at the beginning of each session.
Re-authentication required after 20 minutes of inactivity or before accessing administrative tools, such as exporting student data or modifying system settings.
Sensitivity of Actions & Permission Levels:

High Sensitivity (Administrators): Accessing school-wide performance data, managing teacher and student accounts, and modifying system configurations.
Medium Sensitivity (Teachers): Assigning tasks, viewing student progress reports, and providing feedback.
Low Sensitivity (Students/Parents): Viewing assignments, completing lessons, and accessing progress reports.
3. Non-Functional Requirements
Performance:

System must respond to user actions (e.g., loading quizzes, saving answers) within 2 seconds for 95% of cases.
Voice recognition and feedback should process inputs within 5 seconds.
Scalability:

Supports up to 50,000 concurrent users during national testing periods.
Scales horizontally to accommodate additional schools in the region.
Reliability:

99.5% uptime with failover mechanisms for critical components.
Data recovery within 1 hour in case of server failure.
Security:

Role-based access controls and end-to-end encryption for all data.
Regular penetration testing to identify vulnerabilities.
Usability:

Accessible interface with multilingual support for system navigation.
Compliance with WCAG 2.1 accessibility standards for visually impaired users.
Audit & Monitoring:

Logs all sensitive actions (e.g., account modifications, data exports) for a 12-month retention period.
Real-time alerts for suspicious activities, such as repeated failed login attempts.
4. Constraints
Technical Constraints:

System must operate on devices with limited computing power, such as low-cost tablets.
Limited offline capabilities due to the real-time nature of adaptive learning.
Compliance Requirements:

Complies with the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA).
Meets requirements for data retention and accessibility set by regional education authorities.
Resource Constraints:

Development budget limited to $3 million over 15 months.
Limited availability of AI experts for fine-tuning the adaptive engine, requiring phased rollout of advanced features.
Integration Needs:

Integrates with existing Student Information Systems (SIS) for user management.
Compatible with third-party language assessment tools and virtual classrooms like Zoom.
This scenario is realistic, addresses industry-specific challenges, and aligns with business and technical constraints while meeting the requirements of the template.
