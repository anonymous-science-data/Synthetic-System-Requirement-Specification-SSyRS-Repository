Scenario: Virtual Classroom Authentication System for the Education Sector
1. System Overview
System Purpose:
To provide a secure and efficient authentication system for virtual classrooms, ensuring only authorized users access live lectures, recordings, and collaboration tools.

Domain/Context:
Education, focused on remote and hybrid learning environments across K-12, higher education, and professional training programs.

Stakeholders:

Students: Accessing virtual classrooms, resources, and assignments.
Teachers/Instructors: Hosting and managing virtual classes, tracking attendance, and grading.
Parents/Guardians: Monitoring student progress (K-12).
School Administrators: Managing system usage, reports, and compliance.
IT Support Staff: Ensuring smooth operation and troubleshooting issues.
User Base Characteristics:

Size: Small schools with hundreds of users to large institutions with tens of thousands.
Diversity: Encompasses users of all ages, technical skill levels, and roles.
Geographic Distribution: Global, with users accessing from urban centers to remote areas.
Roles: Students, teachers, administrators, and support staff.
2. Functional Requirements
Core Features:

Multi-factor authentication (MFA) for enhanced security.
Biometric authentication support for advanced users.
Single sign-on (SSO) for access across multiple education platforms.
Role-based access control for distinct permissions (e.g., teacher, student).
Automatic logout for inactive sessions to prevent unauthorized access.
Frequency of Authentication:

Per session: Required for accessing the virtual classroom system.
Per action: For sensitive operations like grade input or modifying user roles.
Sensitivity of Actions:

High sensitivity: Managing class recordings, grades, and student attendance data.
Medium sensitivity: Uploading teaching materials or submitting assignments.
Low sensitivity: Viewing general announcements or public resources.
3. Non-Functional Requirements
Performance:

System must handle authentication within 3 seconds for up to 50,000 concurrent users during peak times.
Scalability:

Ability to scale to accommodate an additional 25% user base during exam or enrollment periods.
Reliability:

99.9% uptime with robust error-handling mechanisms.
Automatic failover and disaster recovery processes for minimal disruptions.
Security:

End-to-end encryption of user credentials and session data.
Periodic security assessments and adherence to international data protection standards like GDPR and FERPA.
Usability:

Simple, intuitive interface for non-technical users.
Accessibility features (e.g., screen reader compatibility, multilingual support).
4. Constraints
Technical Constraints:

Limited bandwidth in rural and remote regions may impact system access.
Compatibility with older devices and operating systems.
Compliance Requirements:

Must comply with FERPA (U.S.) and GDPR (EU) for data protection.
Adherence to accessibility standards such as WCAG for inclusivity.
Resource Constraints:

Budget limitations in public and non-profit schools.
Staffing shortages for IT support during peak usage periods.
Integration Needs:

Seamless integration with popular Learning Management Systems (LMS) like Google Classroom, Canvas, or Blackboard.
Support for third-party tools, including video conferencing platforms like Zoom or Microsoft Teams.
This scenario outlines a robust, scalable, and secure authentication system tailored for virtual classrooms, addressing the unique needs and constraints of the education sector.
