Scenario: Learning Management System (LMS) Authentication for the Education Sector
1. System Overview
System Purpose:
To provide a robust, secure, and user-friendly authentication system for a Learning Management System (LMS) used by educational institutions, enabling secure access to courses, grades, and administrative tools.

Domain/Context:
Education, supporting K-12 schools, higher education institutions, and online education platforms.

Stakeholders:

Students: Primary users accessing courses, assignments, and grades.
Teachers: Managing course content, grading, and student interactions.
Administrators: Overseeing user accounts, reports, and institutional compliance.
Parents/Guardians: Accessing progress reports (in K-12 systems).
IT Support Staff: Maintaining and troubleshooting the system.
User Base Characteristics:

Size: Small institutions with hundreds of users to large-scale universities and platforms with millions.
Diversity: Users range from young children in K-12 to adults in higher education or professional training.
Geographic Distribution: Users from various locations worldwide, including urban, rural, and remote areas.
Roles: Includes students, educators, support staff, and administrators with distinct access requirements.
2. Functional Requirements
Core Features:

Multi-factor authentication (MFA) for enhanced security.
Role-based access control to assign permissions based on user roles (e.g., teacher, student).
Password recovery and account management functionalities.
Integration with existing Student Information Systems (SIS) for seamless user provisioning.
Support for biometric and OAuth-based authentication for advanced scenarios.
Frequency of Authentication:

Per session: Required for students and teachers to access the LMS.
Per action: Required for sensitive operations, such as grading, administrative changes, or accessing financial records.
Sensitivity of Actions:

High sensitivity: Accessing personal student data, financial information, or administrative tools.
Medium sensitivity: Submitting assignments or managing course content.
Low sensitivity: Browsing public course information or forums.
3. Non-Functional Requirements
Performance:

Login response times must not exceed 2 seconds.
System must support up to 500,000 concurrent users during peak times.
Scalability:

Capable of handling sudden spikes, such as during enrollment or exams.
Easily expandable to accommodate new institutions or courses.
Reliability:

99.9% system uptime with backup and recovery mechanisms.
Failover capabilities to maintain access during localized outages.
Security:

End-to-end encryption of data in transit and at rest.
Periodic security audits and updates to address vulnerabilities.
Compliance with FERPA, GDPR, and other applicable regulations.
Usability:

Intuitive interface suitable for users with varying technical skills.
Accessibility features for visually and hearing-impaired users.
Support for multiple languages to serve diverse user populations.
4. Constraints
Technical Constraints:

Compatibility with legacy hardware in older institutions.
Limited bandwidth in rural or remote locations.
Compliance Requirements:

Adherence to FERPA (U.S.) and GDPR (EU) for handling sensitive educational data.
WCAG compliance for accessibility.
Resource Constraints:

Budget limitations for small schools or non-profits.
Development timelines tied to academic schedules.
Integration Needs:

Integration with widely-used LMS platforms like Moodle, Blackboard, or Canvas.
Support for third-party tools like video conferencing platforms and assessment software.
This scenario provides a realistic, comprehensive, and domain-specific framework for an authentication system in the education sector.
