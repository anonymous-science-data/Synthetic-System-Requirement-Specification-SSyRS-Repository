Scenario: Education Sector Authentication System
1. System Overview
System Purpose:
To provide a secure, user-friendly authentication system that ensures authorized access to educational platforms, supports diverse learning environments, and protects sensitive academic data.

Domain/Context:
Education, encompassing K-12 schools, universities, online learning platforms, and professional training institutions.

Stakeholders:

Students
Teachers and educators
School administrators
Parents/guardians
IT departments
External accreditation bodies
User Base Characteristics:

Size: Varies from small schools with hundreds of users to large universities and platforms with millions.
Diversity: Encompasses different age groups, technical proficiency levels, and roles.
Geographic Distribution: Global, with users spread across urban, rural, and remote areas.
Roles: Includes learners, educators, support staff, and system administrators.
2. Functional Requirements
Core Features:

Multi-factor authentication (MFA) for enhanced security.
Single sign-on (SSO) for seamless access across multiple educational tools and resources.
Role-based access control to restrict permissions based on user roles (e.g., teacher vs. student).
Password recovery and account management features.
Support for biometric authentication (e.g., fingerprint, facial recognition) for advanced use cases.
Frequency of Authentication:

Per session for students and teachers accessing platforms.
Per action for sensitive activities, such as accessing grades, financial records, or administrative tools.
Sensitivity of Actions:

High: Viewing/editing student records, financial transactions, or examination content.
Medium: Accessing course materials or submitting assignments.
Low: Browsing public course information or discussion forums.
3. Non-Functional Requirements
Performance:

Response times of <2 seconds for login and access verification.
Capability to handle at least 1,000 concurrent logins in small-scale institutions and millions in larger systems.
Scalability:

Scalable to support sudden spikes during enrollment or examination periods.
Expandable to accommodate additional users and institutions.
Reliability:

99.9% uptime with robust failover mechanisms.
Automatic recovery from minor disruptions and disaster recovery processes.
Security:

Encryption of data at rest and in transit.
Regular vulnerability assessments and penetration testing.
Compliance with FERPA, GDPR, or other regional educational data protection regulations.
Usability:

Simple, intuitive interface for users of varying technical skill levels.
Accessibility features like screen readers, language localization, and mobile-friendly design.
4. Constraints
Technical Constraints:

Compatibility with legacy systems in older institutions.
Support for diverse device ecosystems, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones.
Compliance Requirements:

Adherence to legal frameworks like FERPA (U.S.) and GDPR (EU).
Conformance with accessibility standards, such as WCAG.
Resource Constraints:

Limited IT budgets for smaller schools or non-profit institutions.
Restricted development timelines aligned with academic calendars.
Integration Needs:

Seamless integration with existing Learning Management Systems (LMS) like Moodle, Blackboard, or Canvas.
Support for third-party applications, including video conferencing tools and library management systems.
This scenario outlines the requirements and constraints for a robust authentication system tailored for the education sector, balancing security, usability, and scalability to meet diverse needs.
