Scenario: Education Software System - Digital Assessment and Learning Analytics Platform
1. System Overview
System Purpose:
The system aims to streamline digital assessments, provide actionable learning analytics, and enhance the personalization of student learning experiences. It will facilitate efficient exam management, automated grading, and data-driven insights to improve student outcomes and institutional performance.

Domain/Context:
The system operates within the education sector, serving primary, secondary, and higher education institutions.

Stakeholders:

Students: End-users who take assessments and view performance feedback.
Teachers/Instructors: Key users who create and manage assessments, track progress, and analyze student data.
Administrators: Manage institution-wide configurations, user roles, and access control.
Parents/Guardians: View reports for K-12 students.
IT Teams: Maintain the system's infrastructure and ensure seamless operation.
User Base Characteristics:

Approximately 100,000 active users at launch, scaling up to 500,000 within two years.
Includes diverse roles: 70% students, 20% teachers, 5% administrators, and 5% parents.
Users span multiple geographic regions, primarily within urban and suburban areas.
Operational Environment:

A cloud-hosted platform accessible via web and mobile applications.
Compatible with commonly used devices such as laptops, tablets, and smartphones.
Usage Scenarios:

Students: Log in to take assessments, review feedback, and track progress.
Teachers: Create question banks, schedule assessments, and monitor class-wide performance trends.
Administrators: Manage roles, enforce institution-wide policies, and audit usage reports.
2. Functional Requirements
Core Features:

Assessment Management: Tools for creating, scheduling, and distributing online exams.
Automated Grading: AI-driven grading for objective questions and semi-automated workflows for subjective questions.
Learning Analytics: Dashboards showing performance trends, progress metrics, and predictive insights for personalized learning.
Reporting Tools: Customizable reports for stakeholders, including export options in multiple formats.
Integration Capabilities: Compatibility with existing Learning Management Systems (LMS) like Canvas or Moodle.
Authentication Conditions & Frequency:

Users must authenticate at the beginning of each session.
Re-authentication is required after 30 minutes of inactivity or for sensitive actions such as exporting reports or changing account settings.
Sensitivity of Actions & Permission Levels:

Low Sensitivity: Viewing assessments and individual student data (accessible by students and teachers).
Medium Sensitivity: Creating assessments, modifying grades, or accessing aggregated analytics (teachers and administrators).
High Sensitivity: Configuring institution-wide policies, managing user roles, and viewing audit logs (administrators).
3. Non-Functional Requirements
Performance:

The system must handle up to 10,000 concurrent users with an average response time of less than 2 seconds.
Scalability:

Must support a 5x increase in active users within two years with minimal degradation in performance.
Reliability:

99.9% uptime with failover mechanisms in place to minimize disruption.
Automated backups conducted daily, with data retention for up to 5 years.
Security:

End-to-end encryption for data in transit and at rest.
Role-based access control (RBAC) to ensure appropriate access levels.
Usability:

Must comply with WCAG 2.1 Level AA for accessibility.
Provide multilingual support for three major languages at launch (English, Spanish, French).
Audit & Monitoring:

Detailed logging of user actions, including login attempts, data exports, and role changes.
Administrators must be able to generate audit reports within 24 hours of request.
4. Constraints
Technical Constraints:

Hosted on AWS infrastructure using a microservices architecture.
Frontend must be compatible with modern web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge) and support Android and iOS mobile platforms.
Compliance Requirements:

Adherence to GDPR, FERPA, and other regional data protection regulations.
Retention and deletion policies for user data as per regulatory standards.
Resource Constraints:

Budget capped at $2 million for development and implementation.
Development team of 15 members, including frontend/backend developers, data scientists, and QA engineers.
Timeline of 18 months, including 3 months for testing and stakeholder feedback integration.
Integration Needs:

Seamless data exchange with existing LMS platforms via standardized APIs.
Compatibility with institutional Single Sign-On (SSO) systems for user authentication.
This scenario reflects a realistic and well-structured approach to designing and implementing a digital assessment and learning analytics platform, adhering to industry-specific challenges and goals.
