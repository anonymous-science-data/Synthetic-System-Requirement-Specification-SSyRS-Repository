Scenario: Education Software System - Adaptive Learning Management Platform
1. System Overview
System Purpose:
The platform enables adaptive learning experiences tailored to individual student needs, combining content delivery with performance monitoring. The system aims to enhance student engagement, provide personalized learning paths, and support educators with actionable insights into progress and achievement gaps.

Domain/Context:
This system operates within the education sector, specifically serving K-12 schools, higher education institutions, and remote learning environments.

Stakeholders:

Students: Use the platform to access learning modules and track progress.
Educators: Manage course content, review student analytics, and intervene when students face challenges.
Administrators: Configure institution-wide policies, monitor platform usage, and generate compliance reports.
Parents/Guardians: For K-12 institutions, parents access dashboards showing student progress and key learning outcomes.
IT Teams: Oversee platform deployment, maintenance, and security compliance.
User Base Characteristics:

Initial user base of 150,000 across multiple institutions, with an expected growth to 600,000 users in three years.
Includes diverse roles: 65% students, 25% educators, 5% administrators, and 5% parents/guardians.
Users are geographically distributed, primarily in urban and semi-urban areas, with support for multiple time zones.
Operational Environment:

A cloud-based solution hosted on Microsoft Azure, accessible via modern web browsers and mobile apps.
Designed to operate seamlessly across desktops, tablets, and smartphones.
Usage Scenarios:

Students: Access adaptive learning modules, complete assignments, and view their performance dashboards.
Educators: Design course content, track class performance, and provide targeted interventions for struggling students.
Administrators: Monitor compliance with educational standards, manage system settings, and analyze overall institutional performance.
2. Functional Requirements
Core Features:

Adaptive Learning Modules: Dynamic course content that adjusts to the student's learning pace and performance.
Progress Tracking and Analytics: Dashboards for students, educators, and parents to monitor individual and class-wide performance metrics.
Content Authoring Tools: Educators can create, customize, and share learning modules.
Collaborative Learning Spaces: Interactive features for group projects, discussions, and peer-to-peer engagement.
Integration with Virtual Classrooms: Compatibility with popular video conferencing tools (e.g., Zoom, Microsoft Teams).
Authentication Conditions & Frequency:

Authentication required at the start of each session.
Re-authentication triggered after 45 minutes of inactivity or when accessing sensitive features, such as modifying student data or exporting reports.
Sensitivity of Actions & Permission Levels:

Low Sensitivity: Viewing progress dashboards (students, parents).
Medium Sensitivity: Creating or modifying course content, updating individual student records (educators).
High Sensitivity: Adjusting system-wide settings, exporting institutional data, and managing user roles (administrators).
3. Non-Functional Requirements
Performance:

Support 12,000 concurrent users with a response time of under 3 seconds for key actions.
Scalability:

Must scale to accommodate 4x growth in active users over three years with minimal disruption.
Reliability:

Ensure 99.95% uptime, with automated failover mechanisms and a recovery time objective (RTO) of 30 minutes.
Security:

Use end-to-end encryption for data in transit and at rest.
Employ role-based access control (RBAC) for granular permission management.
Usability:

Comply with WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards for accessibility.
Provide a multilingual interface supporting English, Spanish, Mandarin, and French.
Audit & Monitoring:

Maintain detailed logs of user activities, including logins, content modifications, and system changes.
Logs must be accessible for auditing for up to 2 years and exported on demand.
4. Constraints
Technical Constraints:

Must be compatible with existing institutional Single Sign-On (SSO) systems.
Optimized for devices running Windows, macOS, iOS, and Android.
Compliance Requirements:

Adhere to GDPR, FERPA, and regional education data protection standards.
Data must be stored in geographically appropriate regions to comply with local regulations.
Resource Constraints:

Development budget capped at $3 million.
Development team comprises 20 members, including backend/frontend developers, UX designers, data analysts, and QA engineers.
Target implementation time-frame is 20 months, including 4 months for rigorous testing and feedback incorporation.
Integration Needs:

Seamless integration with existing LMS platforms and third-party tools for content management and virtual classrooms.
APIs for secure data exchange with institutional reporting systems.
This scenario is designed to align with the education sector's requirements, emphasizing adaptive learning, robust analytics, and scalability, while adhering to realistic technical and resource constraints.
