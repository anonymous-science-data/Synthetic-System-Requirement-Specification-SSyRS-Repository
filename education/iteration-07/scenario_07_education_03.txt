Scenario: Education Software System - Virtual Classroom and Collaborative Learning Platform
1. System Overview
System Purpose:
The system enables institutions to manage virtual classrooms, facilitate collaborative learning, and provide educators with tools to track and improve student engagement and performance. It emphasizes real-time interaction, flexible content delivery, and integration with existing Learning Management Systems (LMS).

Domain/Context:
This system operates in the education sector, supporting K-12 schools, higher education, and professional training institutions, focusing on both in-person and remote learning environments.

Stakeholders:

Students: Use the system to participate in virtual classrooms, collaborate on group projects, and access learning materials.
Teachers/Educators: Deliver live and asynchronous lessons, assign tasks, and track student participation and outcomes.
School Administrators: Oversee platform usage, generate institutional performance reports, and manage compliance requirements.
IT Teams: Maintain infrastructure, manage integrations, and ensure security compliance.
User Base Characteristics:

Initial user base of 200,000 individuals, scaling to 750,000 over five years.
Diverse roles include 70% students, 20% educators, and 10% administrators.
Distributed across urban and rural regions, with multilingual needs.
Operational Environment:

A cloud-based system hosted on AWS, accessible via web browsers and mobile apps.
Supports synchronous and asynchronous interactions on desktops, laptops, tablets, and smartphones.
Usage Scenarios:

Students: Join live virtual classes, collaborate on assignments in group workspaces, and view their progress dashboards.
Educators: Schedule live sessions, create and manage learning modules, and review individual and class performance metrics.
Administrators: Configure platform settings, ensure compliance with educational standards, and audit usage and engagement reports.
2. Functional Requirements
Core Features:

Virtual Classrooms: Real-time video conferencing with tools for quizzes, polls, and breakout rooms.
Collaborative Workspaces: Shared project spaces for group activities, file sharing, and peer-to-peer discussions.
Progress Tracking: Dashboards providing insights into attendance, engagement, and learning outcomes.
Content Authoring Tools: Tools for educators to create, edit, and distribute multimedia learning materials.
LMS Integration: Seamless compatibility with existing systems such as Blackboard and Canvas.
Authentication Conditions & Frequency:

Users must authenticate at the beginning of each session.
Re-authentication required after 60 minutes of inactivity or when accessing administrative settings or exporting sensitive reports.
Sensitivity of Actions & Permission Levels:

Low Sensitivity: Accessing virtual classes and learning materials (students, educators).
Medium Sensitivity: Modifying course content and viewing class-wide performance reports (educators).
High Sensitivity: Adjusting system configurations, accessing aggregated institutional data, and managing user roles (administrators).
3. Non-Functional Requirements
Performance:

Support 15,000 concurrent users with an average response time of 2 seconds for critical operations.
Scalability:

Handle a 5x increase in users over five years with minimal performance degradation.
Reliability:

Achieve 99.9% uptime with automated failover systems and a recovery time objective (RTO) of 30 minutes.
Security:

Implement end-to-end encryption for all data and provide robust role-based access control.
Regular vulnerability assessments and penetration testing to ensure system integrity.
Usability:

Comply with WCAG 2.1 Level AA for accessibility.
Provide multilingual support in English, Spanish, and French at launch, with plans for expansion.
Audit & Monitoring:

Detailed logging of user actions, including content creation, role modifications, and system changes.
Provide administrators with the ability to generate audit logs within 24 hours.
4. Constraints
Technical Constraints:

Must integrate with institution-provided authentication systems (e.g., Single Sign-On).
Optimized for operation on devices with low-to-moderate processing power to accommodate underserved regions.
Compliance Requirements:

Adherence to GDPR, FERPA, and other regional education standards.
Data residency in compliance with institutional and regulatory guidelines.
Resource Constraints:

Development budget capped at $4 million, accounting for development, testing, and initial deployment.
Development team of 25 members, including developers, UI/UX designers, data analysts, and QA engineers.
Targeted completion in 24 months, including a 4-month pilot phase and user feedback integration.
Integration Needs:

APIs for secure communication with existing LMS platforms and virtual conferencing tools.
Support for seamless data synchronization with institutional reporting systems.
This scenario is carefully designed to align with industry-specific challenges and goals, emphasizing scalability, usability, and integration while adhering to realistic resource constraints.
