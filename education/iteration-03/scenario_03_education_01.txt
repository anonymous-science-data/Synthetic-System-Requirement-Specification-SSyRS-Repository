Scenario: Adaptive Learning Management System (ALMS)

1. System Overview
System Purpose:
The Adaptive Learning Management System (ALMS) is designed to enhance the quality of education by delivering personalized learning experiences. It leverages AI-driven analytics to adapt course content, assessments, and resources to individual student needs, thereby improving engagement and outcomes. The system also supports educators by offering insights into student performance and recommended interventions.

Domain/Context:
The system operates within the education sector, serving K-12 schools, higher education institutions, and vocational training programs.

Stakeholders:

School administrators (manage and monitor institutional performance).
Educators (design courses, track student progress, and implement teaching strategies).
Students (engage with personalized learning content).
Parents (monitor their children's learning journey).
IT staff (ensure system maintenance and compliance).
User Base Characteristics:

Size: Expected to support institutions ranging from small private schools to large universities with 10,000+ users.
Diversity: Students with varying learning abilities, educators with differing pedagogical styles, and parents with varied technological familiarity.
Geographic Distribution: Global, with an emphasis on multilingual and multicultural adaptability.
Roles: Administrators, educators, students, parents, IT staff.
2. Functional Requirements
Core Features:

Personalized content delivery based on student learning styles and progress.
Real-time performance tracking and reporting dashboards for educators and administrators.
AI-driven recommendations for remedial actions and advanced learning resources.
Secure student-teacher communication tools.
Multi-format content support (text, video, interactive exercises).
Parental access to student progress and system notifications.
Frequency of Authentication:

Single sign-on (SSO) per session with optional two-factor authentication (2FA) for sensitive actions.
Sensitivity of Actions:

High Sensitivity: Changing grades, accessing detailed performance reports, and modifying user roles.
Medium Sensitivity: Uploading or modifying course content.
Low Sensitivity: Viewing publicly shared resources.
3. Non-Functional Requirements
Performance:

Maximum response time of 2 seconds for user interactions.
System throughput of 10,000 concurrent users during peak hours.
Scalability:

Elastic cloud infrastructure to handle spikes during enrollment or exam periods.
Support for adding new schools or institutions with minimal configuration effort.
Reliability:

99.9% uptime with automated backup and disaster recovery within 4 hours.
Graceful error handling with user-friendly messages and logging for IT staff diagnostics.
Security:

End-to-end encryption for all data exchanges.
Role-based access control with regular audits.
Compliance with GDPR, FERPA, and other education data protection regulations.
Usability:

Intuitive interfaces optimized for desktop and mobile devices.
Accessibility features, including screen reader support and adjustable font sizes.
Tutorials and context-sensitive help for first-time users.
4. Constraints
Technical Constraints:

Must be deployable on both on-premises servers and cloud-based platforms.
Compatibility with existing student information systems (SIS).
Compliance Requirements:

Adherence to GDPR for European institutions and FERPA for U.S. institutions.
Support for localization in languages with right-to-left scripts (e.g., Arabic, Hebrew).
Resource Constraints:

Initial development budget of $2 million with a 12-month delivery timeline.
Core team limited to 15 developers, designers, and analysts.
Integration Needs:

Seamless integration with widely used learning tools (e.g., Google Classroom, Microsoft Teams).
APIs for connecting with third-party educational content providers.
This scenario outlines a comprehensive adaptive learning solution designed to meet the diverse needs of modern educational institutions.
