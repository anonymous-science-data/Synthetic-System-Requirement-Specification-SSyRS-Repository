Scenario: Collaborative Online Educational Platform (COEP)

1. System Overview
System Purpose:
The Collaborative Online Educational Platform (COEP) aims to revolutionize online learning by fostering real-time collaboration among students and educators. The system supports group learning, project management, and peer-to-peer interaction to enhance engagement and teamwork skills in a virtual environment.

Domain/Context:
The system is tailored for the education sector, targeting K-12 schools, higher education, and professional development programs.

Stakeholders:

Educators (facilitate classes, manage group activities, and assess performance).
Students (engage in group projects, access learning resources, and communicate with peers).
Administrators (monitor usage, performance, and compliance).
Parents (review progress and activity summaries for students).
IT and Support Staff (maintain the system and address technical issues).
User Base Characteristics:

Size: Designed to support small schools with 100 users up to large institutions with over 20,000 users.
Diversity: Includes students with varied academic levels and educators with differing technological proficiencies.
Geographic Distribution: Global access, supporting time zone flexibility for international institutions.
Roles: Educators, students, administrators, parents, and support staff.
2. Functional Requirements
Core Features:

Real-time collaboration tools (shared whiteboards, document editing, breakout rooms).
Project and task management tools for group assignments.
AI-powered feedback on participation and group dynamics.
Integration of gamification elements to encourage collaboration.
Attendance tracking and progress reporting features.
Library of reusable templates for common project types (e.g., presentations, reports).
Frequency of Authentication:

Users authenticate once per session through single sign-on (SSO) with optional 2FA.
Sensitivity of Actions:

High Sensitivity: Editing administrative settings, viewing private student or group performance reports.
Medium Sensitivity: Modifying group projects and shared resources.
Low Sensitivity: Viewing public learning materials.
3. Non-Functional Requirements
Performance:

Response time under 1.5 seconds for real-time collaboration actions.
Support for 5,000 concurrent users per institution during peak periods.
Scalability:

Cloud-native architecture to scale with user demand during high-usage events (e.g., project deadlines).
Reliability:

99.8% system uptime, with automated failover to backup servers within 15 minutes.
Detailed error logging and notification systems for IT staff.
Security:

Data encryption in transit and at rest.
Fine-grained role-based access control.
Compliance with global standards like GDPR and COPPA.
Usability:

Intuitive and responsive user interface, optimized for both desktop and mobile.
Accessibility features for users with disabilities, including closed captioning and keyboard navigation.
Step-by-step tutorials for onboarding new users.
4. Constraints
Technical Constraints:

Must integrate with existing learning management systems (e.g., Blackboard, Canvas).
Compatibility with widely used video conferencing tools (e.g., Zoom, Microsoft Teams).
Compliance Requirements:

Adherence to GDPR, FERPA, and COPPA for data privacy and protection.
Resource Constraints:

Development budget capped at $3 million over 18 months.
Core team limited to 12 members during the initial development phase.
Integration Needs:

Seamless integration with third-party apps for additional functionality (e.g., plagiarism detection, language translation).
APIs to enable third-party educational content providers to contribute directly to the platform.
This scenario outlines an innovative platform designed to address the growing need for collaborative online education in a flexible and accessible way.
