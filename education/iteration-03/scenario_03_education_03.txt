Domain/Context:
This system operates within the education sector, focusing on K-12 schools, higher education, and professional certification programs.

Stakeholders:

Educators (design assessments, monitor performance, and provide feedback).
Students (complete assessments and receive real-time feedback).
Administrators (track overall assessment metrics and institutional performance).
Parents (monitor student progress and assessment outcomes).
IT staff (ensure system reliability, security, and compliance).
User Base Characteristics:

Size: Designed for institutions ranging from small schools with fewer than 500 students to large universities with 50,000+ users.
Diversity: Includes users with varying levels of digital proficiency and accessibility needs.
Geographic Distribution: Supports institutions with global reach, requiring multilingual and multicultural adaptability.

Real-time feedback generation with actionable improvement tips.
Detailed analytics for educators and administrators to identify trends and gaps in learning.
Secure, timed examination modes with proctoring features.
Mobile-friendly interface for accessing assessments and results.
Frequency of Authentication:

Mandatory authentication at the beginning of each session, with optional two-factor authentication for sensitive tasks such as accessing assessment data or proctoring settings.
Sensitivity of Actions:

High Sensitivity: Modifying assessment data, accessing student analytics, and proctoring controls.
Medium Sensitivity: Creating or editing assessments.
Low Sensitivity: Viewing publicly shared study resources or practice tests.
3. Non-Functional Requirements
Performance:

Response times of under 2 seconds for assessment submissions and feedback delivery.
Capable of handling 10,000 concurrent users during peak testing periods.
Scalability:
