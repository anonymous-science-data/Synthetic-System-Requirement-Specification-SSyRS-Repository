Education Software System Scenario
1. System Overview
System Purpose:
The system, "EduEngage LMS," aims to streamline the management and delivery of learning materials, assessments, and real-time interactions for secondary school students and teachers. It integrates educational content, tracks progress, and facilitates teacher-student engagement through personalized dashboards and analytics.

Domain/Context:
Secondary education, focusing on a hybrid learning model to support in-person and remote teaching.

Stakeholders:

Teachers: Manage course materials, assessments, and student progress.
Students: Access learning resources, submit assignments, and participate in discussions.
School Administrators: Monitor system-wide usage, compliance, and performance.
Parents: View reports on student progress and attendance.
IT Support Team: Manage system maintenance and troubleshoot technical issues.
User Base Characteristics:

Approximately 2,000 students and 200 teachers per institution, with 50 institutions initially adopting the system.
Geographically diverse, supporting rural and urban schools.
User roles include students, teachers, administrators, and parents, each requiring different permission levels.
Operational Environment:
Cloud-based solution with a responsive web interface and mobile apps for Android and iOS. Designed for high availability and low-latency access in areas with intermittent internet connectivity.

Usage Scenarios:

Teachers uploading course materials and setting deadlines for assignments.
Students accessing learning modules and submitting assignments.
Parents reviewing attendance reports and academic performance summaries.
Administrators generating school-wide usage and performance analytics.
2. Functional Requirements
Core Features:

Content Management: Teachers can upload, organize, and schedule access to course materials.
Assessment Tools: Online quizzes, assignments, and grading functionality.
Communication: Real-time chat and discussion forums for students and teachers.
Analytics: Dashboards for progress tracking, attendance, and performance metrics.
Multi-Language Support: Localization for diverse language preferences.
Authentication Conditions & Frequency:

Users must authenticate at the start of each session, with automatic logout after 30 minutes of inactivity.
Sensitive actions (e.g., modifying grades, accessing student records) require re-authentication.
Sensitivity of Actions & Permission Levels:

High Sensitivity: Grade modification, financial data access (Administrators).
Moderate Sensitivity: Assignment submissions, attendance tracking (Teachers).
Low Sensitivity: Viewing learning content and progress reports (Students, Parents).
3. Non-Functional Requirements
Performance:

Response times under 2 seconds for 90% of user interactions.
Support for simultaneous use by up to 10,000 concurrent users.
Scalability:

Modular architecture to support up to 100 institutions and 500,000 users without performance degradation.
Reliability:

99.95% uptime, with automatic failover to backup servers during outages.
Security:

Data encryption for all stored and transmitted data.
Role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict access to sensitive data.
Usability:

WCAG 2.1 compliance for accessibility.
User-friendly interfaces with minimal training required for onboarding.
Audit & Monitoring:

Logging of all authentication events and sensitive actions, with tamper-evident logs.
Alerts for unusual activity, such as failed authentication attempts or data exports.
4. Constraints
Technical Constraints:

Must be compatible with existing school infrastructure, including older devices and limited bandwidth environments.
Cloud infrastructure must use AWS or Azure for hosting.
Compliance Requirements:

Adherence to GDPR for student data privacy.
Local educational data policies for different regions.
Resource Constraints:

Budget cap of $2.5 million for initial development and deployment.
Development timeline of 18 months, with a six-month buffer for testing and pilot implementation.
Integration Needs:

Integration with existing Student Information Systems (SIS) for seamless user data synchronization.
Support for Single Sign-On (SSO) with institutional credentials.
This scenario reflects a realistic, scalable implementation of an educational software system tailored to address the operational and technical needs of secondary schools while adhering to strict resource and compliance constraints.
