1. System Overview

System Purpose:
The system, named "Virtual Learning Hub (VLH)," is a hybrid learning management platform designed to enable schools and universities to manage and deliver interactive online and in-person courses. Its primary goal is to bridge the gap between traditional and virtual learning by providing tools for educators to create blended learning experiences that cater to diverse student needs, including remote learners and those with accessibility requirements.

Domain/Context:
VLH operates within the higher education and K-12 domains, targeting institutions transitioning to hybrid learning environments. The system focuses on enabling seamless collaboration between students, educators, and administrators while supporting differentiated instruction for diverse learning groups.

Stakeholders:

    Primary Stakeholders: Teachers, students, and school/university administrators.
    Secondary Stakeholders: IT teams, curriculum designers, parents, and external education content providers.
    Tertiary Stakeholders: Education policymakers and accreditation bodies.

User Base Characteristics:

    Size: Initial deployment supports up to 50,000 users per institution, with the ability to scale to a regional network of 500,000 users.
    Diversity: Users range from tech-savvy college students to K-12 educators with minimal technical expertise. The platform will support multi-language functionality and assistive technology for students with disabilities.
    Geographic Distribution: Focuses on North America, South America, and regions in Africa where hybrid education is rapidly growing.
    Roles: Includes system administrators, teachers, students, parents, and external education content providers.

Operational Environment:
The system will be hosted on a distributed cloud infrastructure to ensure global accessibility and regional data compliance. It will be accessible via web browsers, mobile apps (iOS/Android), and offline desktop applications for areas with limited connectivity.

Usage Scenarios:

    Educators create course content, schedule live virtual classes, and assign assessments to students.
    Students participate in live classes, access recorded lectures, submit assignments, and engage in group discussions.
    Administrators monitor teacher performance, track student engagement, and analyze institutional outcomes.
    Parents (for K-12 learners) view their child’s academic progress and communicate with educators.

2. Functional Requirements

Core Features:

    Comprehensive course management tools for creating, scheduling, and delivering hybrid learning experiences.
    Integrated video conferencing for live classes with recording capabilities.
    Personalized learning dashboards for students with performance analytics and recommendations.
    Content repository with integration support for external resources (e.g., Open Educational Resources).
    Attendance tracking and automated reminders for upcoming classes and deadlines.
    Tools for collaborative projects, including group chat and shared workspaces.
    Role-based access for administrators, educators, and students.

Authentication Conditions & Frequency:

    Users authenticate at the start of each session.
    Re-authentication is required for sensitive actions such as deleting course materials or accessing financial information (e.g., tuition payment records).
    Sessions expire after 45 minutes of inactivity to maintain security.

Sensitivity of Actions & Permission Levels:

    High Sensitivity: Editing institution-wide policies or financial records (accessible only to administrators).
    Medium Sensitivity: Managing course content or grades (restricted to educators).
    Low Sensitivity: Viewing assigned coursework and general dashboards (available to students and parents).

3. Non-Functional Requirements

Performance:

    Response time for standard user actions (e.g., loading a course page) must not exceed 2 seconds.
    System must support up to 5,000 concurrent users per institution during peak hours.

Scalability:

    The system must scale to support up to 500,000 users regionally without significant degradation.
    Cloud-based architecture must allow dynamic scaling during periods of high demand, such as exam seasons.

Reliability:

    The system must achieve an uptime of 99.9% annually.
    Redundancy and failover mechanisms must ensure recovery within 15 minutes of an outage.

Security:

    All data must be encrypted in transit and at rest using AES-256 encryption.
    Role-based access control and audit logging must ensure secure handling of sensitive data.

Usability:

    The user interface must comply with WCAG 2.1 AA standards, ensuring accessibility for users with disabilities.
    Multi-language support for at least 10 languages, including support for right-to-left (RTL) scripts.

Audit & Monitoring:

    Detailed logging of user actions, including sensitive events such as data exports and policy changes.
    Administrators must have access to dashboards for monitoring system health, user activity, and security alerts.

4. Constraints

Technical Constraints:

    The system must integrate with major video conferencing tools like Zoom and Microsoft Teams.
    It must also interface with existing Student Information Systems (SIS) for seamless enrollment and attendance tracking.

Compliance Requirements:

    Adherence to FERPA, COPPA (Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act), and GDPR regulations.
    Annual third-party audits to verify compliance with security and privacy standards.

Resource Constraints:

    Development budget: $3 million USD, inclusive of a two-year post-launch support phase.
    Timeline: 24 months for design, development, testing, and deployment.
    Team size: 35 members, including 20 developers, 5 UX designers, 5 QA specialists, and 5 project managers.

Integration Needs:

    The platform must integrate with external content providers, including Open Educational Resources and digital textbook platforms, via standardized APIs.
    Interoperability with existing grading and analytics tools is required to enhance institutional reporting capabilities.

This refined scenario ensures a realistic, scalable, and innovative solution tailored to hybrid learning environments while considering the unique challenges and objectives of the Education domain.
