1. System Overview

System Purpose:
The system, titled "EduTrack Insights," is a cloud-based analytics and student performance monitoring platform. Its primary objective is to provide educators, school administrators, and policymakers with detailed, real-time insights into student progress, attendance, and overall institutional performance. The system will support data-driven decision-making to improve educational outcomes and institutional efficiency.

Domain/Context:
EduTrack Insights operates within the K-12 education domain, targeting public and private educational institutions globally. The system is designed to address challenges in tracking academic performance, managing student data, and ensuring compliance with regional education standards.

Stakeholders:

    Primary Stakeholders: Teachers, school administrators, and district-level policymakers.
    Secondary Stakeholders: Parents and guardians, IT staff, and education regulatory bodies.
    Tertiary Stakeholders: Software vendors providing integration solutions and third-party assessment tool providers.

User Base Characteristics:

    Size: The platform supports 100,000â€“250,000 active users per region, with scalability to accommodate national deployments.
    Diversity: Users include teachers, administrative staff, parents, and students from diverse linguistic and socioeconomic backgrounds.
    Geographic Distribution: The initial launch targets the Asia-Pacific region, with plans for expansion to North America and Europe.
    Roles: Users will include system administrators, educators, district officials, and parents accessing different system capabilities.

Operational Environment:
The system will be hosted on a multi-tenant cloud platform for global accessibility, with dedicated regional data centers for compliance. It will support mobile (iOS and Android apps) and web-based access, ensuring compatibility with low-bandwidth environments in rural areas.

Usage Scenarios:

    Teachers upload weekly student assessments and receive automated performance analytics.
    Administrators monitor attendance trends and receive alerts for schools with declining participation.
    Parents access a dashboard to view their child's progress, attendance, and upcoming assignments.
    District officials generate reports to evaluate the impact of new educational initiatives.

2. Functional Requirements

Core Features:

    Centralized student performance dashboards with customizable views.
    Attendance tracking and trend analysis with automated alerts for anomalies.
    Integration with third-party assessment tools to import standardized test scores.
    Real-time analytics with predictive insights for at-risk students.
    Parent and guardian portals for viewing individual student progress and teacher feedback.
    Multi-language support for global deployment.
    Role-based access control to restrict access to sensitive student data.

Authentication Conditions & Frequency:

    Users will authenticate at the start of each session.
    Sensitive actions, such as exporting student data or generating district-wide reports, will require re-authentication.
    Sessions will expire after 30 minutes of inactivity to enhance security.

Sensitivity of Actions & Permission Levels:

    High Sensitivity: Data exports, access to district-wide performance reports (available to administrators and district officials).
    Medium Sensitivity: Viewing individual student records (available to teachers and parents).
    Low Sensitivity: Viewing system announcements and non-personalized performance trends (available to all users).

3. Non-Functional Requirements

Performance:

    The system must respond to user queries within 2 seconds for 95% of requests.
    Capable of processing up to 10,000 concurrent users during peak usage periods (e.g., grading seasons).

Scalability:

    The system must support scaling up to 1 million users per region without a significant drop in performance.
    Designed to handle increasing data volumes with modular architecture and dynamic resource allocation.

Reliability:

    The system must have 99.9% uptime, with automatic failover capabilities during outages.
    Weekly backups and disaster recovery mechanisms to ensure data integrity.

Security:

    All data must be encrypted both in transit (TLS 1.3) and at rest (AES-256).
    Role-based access control (RBAC) must be enforced across all features.
    Logs must be anonymized and stored in compliance with GDPR and regional regulations.

Usability:

    Mobile apps and web interfaces must adhere to WCAG 2.1 AA standards for accessibility.
    The user interface should support at least 10 languages and include offline functionality for limited connectivity scenarios.

Audit & Monitoring:

    Comprehensive logging of all user actions, including authentication events, data exports, and report generation.
    Monitoring dashboards for IT administrators to track system health and potential security threats.

4. Constraints

Technical Constraints:

    The system must integrate with existing student information systems (SIS) via standardized APIs.
    Support for low-bandwidth environments with a fallback to lightweight interfaces for users with poor connectivity.

Compliance Requirements:

    Adherence to GDPR, FERPA (Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act), and local data protection laws in the targeted regions.
    Regular audits to ensure continued compliance with regional and international regulations.

Resource Constraints:

    Initial development budget: $2.5 million USD.
    Timeline: 18 months, including development, testing, and phased deployment.
    Team size: 25 members, including developers, QA specialists, domain experts, and project managers.

Integration Needs:

    The system must integrate with Google Classroom, Microsoft Teams, and regional learning management systems (LMS).
    Interoperability with existing third-party analytics and assessment platforms.

This scenario ensures a robust and scalable solution tailored to the education sector, addressing challenges in student performance tracking while adhering to best practices and realistic constraints.
