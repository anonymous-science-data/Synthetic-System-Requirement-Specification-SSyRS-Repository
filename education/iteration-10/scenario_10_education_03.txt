1. System Overview

System Purpose:
The system, called "EduMatch Engage," is a personalized student mentorship and career guidance platform. Its primary goal is to connect students with mentors, resources, and career opportunities tailored to their individual interests, strengths, and learning profiles. It provides tools for career planning, skill development, and progress tracking while ensuring inclusivity for students from underrepresented communities.

Domain/Context:
EduMatch Engage operates within the K-12 and higher education sectors, targeting schools, colleges, and vocational training institutes seeking to enhance their career readiness programs and mentorship networks.

Stakeholders:

    Primary Stakeholders: Students, teachers, career counselors, and mentors.
    Secondary Stakeholders: School administrators, parents, and corporate partners offering internships and job opportunities.
    Tertiary Stakeholders: Non-profit organizations focused on bridging the skills gap in education.

User Base Characteristics:

    Size: Supports a mid-sized network of up to 200,000 users initially, with scalability for regional/national programs targeting 1 million users.
    Diversity: Includes high school students, college students, counselors, industry mentors, and administrators. The platform accommodates users from various socioeconomic and linguistic backgrounds, with a focus on inclusivity for rural and underserved regions.
    Geographic Distribution: Initial deployment targets North America and South Asia, with localized versions for regional language and cultural adaptation.
    Roles: Students access mentorship tools and resources, mentors provide guidance and feedback, and administrators oversee participation and outcomes.

Operational Environment:
The platform will be hosted on a multi-cloud infrastructure to ensure scalability, data sovereignty, and regional compliance. It will be accessible via web browsers and mobile applications, with offline capabilities for resource viewing in low-connectivity areas.

Usage Scenarios:

    Students complete a career aptitude assessment, receive personalized suggestions, and connect with industry mentors in their fields of interest.
    Mentors schedule virtual or in-person sessions with mentees and track their progress via goal-setting tools.
    Career counselors monitor student engagement, recommend additional resources, and generate reports for administrators.
    Administrators analyze platform-wide trends to measure program success and report on student career readiness metrics.

2. Functional Requirements

Core Features:

    Career aptitude assessments and personalized career guidance recommendations.
    Mentor matching based on student interests, career goals, and geographic proximity.
    Progress tracking tools, including goal setting, feedback mechanisms, and completion certificates.
    Virtual and in-person mentorship session scheduling with reminders.
    Integrated resource library featuring guides, videos, and learning modules for career readiness.
    Role-based dashboards for students, mentors, counselors, and administrators.
    Analytics and reporting tools for administrators to measure student engagement and outcomes.

Authentication Conditions & Frequency:

    Users authenticate at the start of each session.
    Re-authentication is required for sensitive actions, such as exporting user data or modifying mentor-mentee assignments.
    Sessions expire after 30 minutes of inactivity for data security.

Sensitivity of Actions & Permission Levels:

    High Sensitivity: Exporting program-wide reports or altering user data (accessible to administrators).
    Medium Sensitivity: Approving mentor-mentee matches and scheduling sessions (accessible to mentors and counselors).
    Low Sensitivity: Viewing progress dashboards or accessing career resources (accessible to all users).

3. Non-Functional Requirements

Performance:

    The system must respond to standard user actions (e.g., loading a dashboard) within 1.5 seconds.
    It must support 10,000 concurrent users during peak usage periods, such as program enrollment seasons.

Scalability:

    The platform must scale to support up to 1 million users in multiple regions, with additional cloud infrastructure as demand grows.

Reliability:

    The system must achieve 99.95% uptime, with failover mechanisms ensuring recovery within 10 minutes during outages.

Security:

    All user data must be encrypted at rest and in transit (AES-256 for storage, TLS 1.3 for communication).
    Role-based access control (RBAC) must ensure data is only accessible by authorized users.

Usability:

    The platform must meet WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility standards, supporting users with disabilities.
    Localization for at least 8 languages, including support for right-to-left (RTL) scripts.

Audit & Monitoring:

    Detailed logs of all user actions, including mentor approvals, session scheduling, and data exports, must be maintained for 12 months.
    Administrators must have real-time dashboards to monitor system health, user activity, and suspicious behavior.

4. Constraints

Technical Constraints:

    The platform must integrate with existing Learning Management Systems (LMS) and video conferencing tools (e.g., Microsoft Teams, Zoom).
    It must support low-bandwidth environments with lightweight interfaces and offline resource access.

Compliance Requirements:

    Adherence to GDPR, FERPA, and regional data protection laws in North America and South Asia.
    Compliance with industry-specific privacy guidelines for minors and mentorship programs.

Resource Constraints:

    Development budget: $4 million USD, with an additional $500,000 allocated for the first year of maintenance and support.
    Timeline: 20 months, including design, development, testing, and deployment phases.
    Team size: 30 members, including 15 developers, 5 UX/UI designers, 5 QA engineers, and 5 project managers.

Integration Needs:

    The system must integrate with existing career resource platforms and assessment tools through standardized APIs.
    Real-time data syncing with institutional Student Information Systems (SIS) is required for enrollment and progress tracking.

This scenario provides a realistic and diverse solution that addresses the unique challenges of career guidance and mentorship in the Education domain, ensuring scalability, inclusivity, and compliance with regional standards.
