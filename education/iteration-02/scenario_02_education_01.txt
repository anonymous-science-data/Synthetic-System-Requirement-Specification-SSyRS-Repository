1. System Overview
System Purpose:
The system, named "EduAuthConnect," aims to provide a seamless, secure, and accessible authentication platform tailored for educational institutions. Its primary objectives are to ensure secure access to online learning resources, streamline identity verification for assessments, and foster collaboration across diverse educational stakeholders.

Domain/Context:
Education, including K-12 schools, universities, vocational training centers, and online learning platforms.

Stakeholders:

Students: Primary users who access learning materials, assessments, and communication tools.
Educators: Teachers and professors who manage courses and interact with students.
Administrators: Personnel managing user access, data security, and compliance.
Parents/Guardians: Stakeholders monitoring student progress (primarily for K-12).
IT Teams: Responsible for system deployment, maintenance, and troubleshooting.
User Base Characteristics:

Size: Ranges from small schools (hundreds of users) to large universities (tens of thousands).
Diversity: Users from varied educational, cultural, and technological backgrounds.
Geographic Distribution: Local, national, and international users, depending on the institution.
Roles: Students, educators, administrators, IT staff, and external auditors.
2. Functional Requirements
Core Features:

Single Sign-On (SSO) for accessing multiple resources (e.g., learning management systems, library databases).
Multi-factor authentication (MFA) for sensitive actions, such as accessing grades or exam portals.
Role-based access control to ensure users only access relevant resources.
Passwordless authentication options, such as biometrics or magic links, to simplify the login process.
Attendance tracking integrated with authentication.
Automated user provisioning and de-provisioning tied to enrollment and employment status.
Frequency of Authentication:

Session-based authentication for most users (e.g., daily login).
Step-up authentication for high-sensitivity actions (e.g., accessing grade changes or exam submissions).
Sensitivity of Actions:

High sensitivity: Accessing exam results, submitting final assignments, and managing institutional data.
Medium sensitivity: Viewing course materials and participating in discussions.
Low sensitivity: Browsing general information or public content.
3. Non-Functional Requirements
Performance:

Authentication response time must not exceed 2 seconds under typical loads.
System throughput should handle up to 100,000 login requests per hour during peak times (e.g., exam periods).
Scalability:

Designed to accommodate institutions of varying sizes, with support for scaling to over 1 million users globally.
Reliability:

99.9% uptime requirement with automated failover mechanisms.
Robust error handling with user-friendly messaging for authentication failures.
Security:

End-to-end encryption of authentication data.
Regular penetration testing and adherence to security standards such as ISO 27001.
Context-aware authentication to detect and mitigate unusual login behavior.
Usability:

Intuitive interfaces with support for multiple languages.
Compliance with accessibility standards (e.g., WCAG 2.1).
Easy self-service options for password recovery and account management.
4. Constraints
Technical Constraints:

Must integrate with existing learning management systems (LMS) like Moodle, Blackboard, or Canvas.
Compatibility with diverse devices, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones.
Compliance Requirements:

Adherence to FERPA (Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act) for US-based institutions.
Compliance with GDPR for institutions serving European students.
Resource Constraints:

Budget cap for initial deployment at $500,000.
Limited IT staff availability during the academic year.
Integration Needs:

Seamless connection with third-party systems, including identity providers (e.g., Google, Microsoft).
Support for legacy authentication systems during the transition phase.
