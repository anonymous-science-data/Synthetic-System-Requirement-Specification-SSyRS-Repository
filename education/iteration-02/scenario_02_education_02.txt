1. System Overview
System Purpose:
The system, named "EduSafeID," is designed to enhance the security and convenience of identity management for educational institutions. Its goals include providing secure access to campus facilities, digital resources, and hybrid learning environments while streamlining administrative processes like enrollment and exam authentication.

Domain/Context:
Education, with a focus on both traditional in-person institutions and hybrid/online education models.

Stakeholders:

Students: Primary users who rely on the system for accessing classes, materials, and campus facilities.
Faculty and Staff: Educators and support staff who use the system to manage academic and administrative functions.
Parents/Guardians: Users accessing portals for tracking progress and communication (especially in K-12).
Institution Administrators: Manage access policies, compliance, and system oversight.
IT Teams: Oversee the implementation, monitoring, and maintenance of the system.
Third-Party Vendors: Partners providing learning platforms, assessment tools, or campus infrastructure.
User Base Characteristics:

Size: Ranges from small local schools (hundreds of users) to international universities (hundreds of thousands).
Diversity: Users vary in age, technical proficiency, and access needs.
Geographic Distribution: Includes urban, suburban, and rural institutions, along with international and distance learners.
Roles: Encompasses a wide spectrum from students and educators to administrators and parents.
2. Functional Requirements
Core Features:

Biometric-based access for physical facilities (e.g., fingerprint or facial recognition for secure buildings like labs).
Integration with learning platforms for seamless access to digital materials and tools.
Secure exam authentication using MFA (e.g., combining biometrics with one-time codes).
Customizable role-based permissions for different user groups (e.g., library access for students, payroll for staff).
Automated alert system for unusual access patterns or breaches.
Remote authentication options for online learning and virtual classrooms.
Frequency of Authentication:

Daily login for general platform access.
Per-action authentication for sensitive operations like exam submissions or financial transactions.
Sensitivity of Actions:

High sensitivity: Financial aid access, faculty payroll, and submission of final grades.
Medium sensitivity: Attendance logging and access to class rosters.
Low sensitivity: Viewing course schedules or public resources.
3. Non-Functional Requirements
Performance:

Authentication processes should not exceed 1.5 seconds for campus facilities and 2 seconds for online resources.
System must handle up to 50,000 concurrent users during peak times (e.g., semester start or exam periods).
Scalability:

Support for a dynamic user base, with seasonal spikes like admissions or graduations.
Easily expandable to accommodate new facilities or tools without major overhauls.
Reliability:

Maintain 99.95% uptime, with redundancies for power outages or server failures.
Real-time monitoring and automatic failover for critical authentication functions.
Security:

Strong encryption for data at rest and in transit.
Role-based access control integrated with advanced logging for auditing.
Regular vulnerability assessments and rapid patching.
Usability:

Intuitive interfaces designed for all user levels, with quick-start guides and video tutorials.
Accessibility features such as text-to-speech and high-contrast options for visually impaired users.
4. Constraints
Technical Constraints:

System must integrate with existing infrastructure, including legacy LMS platforms and campus security systems.
Ensure compatibility across devices (e.g., desktops, tablets, and smartphones) and operating systems.
Compliance Requirements:

Adherence to education-specific regulations like FERPA for the US and GDPR for European users.
Compliance with accessibility standards (e.g., WCAG 2.1) for inclusivity.
Resource Constraints:

Implementation budget capped at $750,000, including licensing fees.
Limited IT staff availability during school operational hours.
Integration Needs:

Direct integration with popular third-party platforms (e.g., Zoom, Google Workspace, Microsoft Teams).
Support for APIs to enable future system extensions and interoperability.
