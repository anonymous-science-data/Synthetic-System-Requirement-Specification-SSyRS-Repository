1. System Overview
System Purpose:
The system, named "LearnID Secure," is designed to provide centralized and secure authentication for educational platforms and physical campuses. Its objectives include ensuring reliable access to digital learning tools, protecting sensitive student and faculty data, and supporting remote and on-campus operations seamlessly.

Domain/Context:
Education, focusing on K-12 schools, universities, and professional training centers.

Stakeholders:

Students: Access online resources, physical facilities, and participate in classes or exams.
Faculty: Manage courses, communicate with students, and access academic data.
Administrators: Oversee data security, compliance, and system access controls.
Parents/Guardians: Engage with student progress reports and communication tools (primarily in K-12).
External Partners: Vendors and external examiners requiring temporary access.
IT Departments: Responsible for deploying and maintaining the system.
User Base Characteristics:

Size: Varies from small (under 1,000 users) to large institutions (over 100,000 users).
Diversity: Users of all ages, technical proficiencies, and accessibility needs.
Geographic Distribution: Local schools, regional training hubs, and global online learners.
Roles: Includes a mix of students, teachers, parents, and technical staff.
2. Functional Requirements
Core Features:

Multi-factor authentication (MFA) combining mobile OTPs and device-based security keys.
Dynamic access control that adjusts based on user roles, location, and time of access.
Secure file sharing for collaborative projects between students and faculty.
Integration with student management systems for automated account creation and suspension.
Attendance tracking tied to system authentication for in-person and remote classes.
Support for guest access with time-limited credentials.
Frequency of Authentication:

Per session login for regular users.
Additional authentication required for accessing sensitive operations or performing high-risk actions.
Sensitivity of Actions:

High sensitivity: Submitting final grades, viewing student financial details, and accessing administrative dashboards.
Medium sensitivity: Sharing or accessing coursework, project files, and class rosters.
Low sensitivity: Viewing course schedules or accessing general announcements.
3. Non-Functional Requirements
Performance:

Authentication must be completed within 1.5 seconds under typical conditions.
The system must handle up to 80,000 concurrent users during peak hours (e.g., exam week).
Scalability:

Support for gradual user base growth, accommodating new departments, campuses, or digital platforms.
Reliability:

Guaranteed 99.9% uptime with failover mechanisms for critical authentication processes.
Real-time error detection and automated recovery processes to minimize disruptions.
Security:

End-to-end encryption for all authentication data.
Machine learning-based threat detection for suspicious login attempts.
Regular security audits and adherence to industry standards (e.g., ISO 27001).
Usability:

User-friendly interface with support for multiple languages.
Accessibility features for users with disabilities, including screen readers and voice input.
4. Constraints
Technical Constraints:

Must be compatible with existing infrastructure, including legacy Learning Management Systems (LMS) and library systems.
Operable on devices with low computational power (e.g., older smartphones or school-provided tablets).
Compliance Requirements:

Adherence to FERPA, GDPR, and CCPA for data protection and privacy.
Compliance with local government regulations on data storage and access control.
Resource Constraints:

Development and implementation budget capped at $600,000.
Limited access to IT personnel during peak school operational hours.
Integration Needs:

Direct integration with video conferencing platforms (e.g., Microsoft Teams, Zoom).
API support for third-party application interoperability, such as e-library systems and gradebooks.
